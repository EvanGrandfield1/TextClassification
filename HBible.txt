                                                              Simple Reading Schedule


            6
                This is a simple reading schedule designed to be followed for 20 minutes a day over a 2-month period. Empty your
            mind. Read God’s Word like a child would for the first time. Never read it with preconceived ideas or thoughts or to
            prove something! Remember to pray. Don’t try to understand everything. Note what you don’t understand and move
            on. Reread those notes later and they may make more sense. This arrangement is for better understanding by letting
            books build on each other. It is arranged roughly in chronological order. Use Sundays to catch up on days you could
            not spend 20 minutes with the Word of God. If you have never read the Bible, always start with the New Testament. The
            New Testament is what you will be judged by, not the Old Testament. It is not wise to read the Old Testament and New
            Testament together; the O.T. Jewish Law maybe confused with N.T. teachings. Spend the first Monday reading the
            Preface and other non-bible sections to familiarize yourself with the MLV’s style of translation.
                The Modern Literal Versions strongest feature is its consistency in translating the original Greek word into the same
            English word(s) every time and not using the same English word for multiple Greek words, so you should read the
            Modern Literal Version once all the way through and do not use any other translation during this time to gain knowledge
            from this uniformity. Then you too will understand why so many of the emails to us are ‘I have learned so much just
            reading the MLV once,’ or similar.

                                                             Definitions TOC
    * Asterisks are used for denoting words listed in the ‘Definitions’ section below. These are for the few instances where the English
translation does not lend itself to a satisfactory meaning of the underlying Greek word. In addition, we use an asterisk to denote the
difference between one English word that is being used for two different Greek words (for example, see Age* below.) This
substantially aids word studies and concordance look ups.
    ° Degree signs are used to denote plural you° and commands where a plural subject is not clearly stated (imperative 2nd person
plural most often).
    - Hyphens are used in those places where two English words come from a single Greek word. It is of particular benefit to Bible
students who wish to cross-reference words to the MLV concordance and Greek lexicon.
    Italicized words are words not found directly in the Greek but implied by the context, needed to help show action, tense or
expansion of the meaning of words that the literal English does not convey, remove the possible appearance of a contradiction, etc.
    Since the MLV is literal, not ‘thought-for-thought,’ supplied words are of significant assistance for those phrases which are
exceptionally difficult to read. By pointing out these words using italics, the reader has the option to disregard them.
    A, An (indefinite articles) are always supplied words in English but not marked with italics in the text.
    Age* is Strong’s Dictionary number 2244 (hereafter, we will abbreviate as G2244 for electronic and book uniformity). It is used
in very much the same way we think of a person’s ‘age.’ The other ‘age, ages’ without the *, is for a period of time. This ‘age’ is also
translated as ‘world’ 22 times. Context determines which word should be used.
    Admonish means to ‘instruct with warning’ G3560.
    And from G2532 is used the way we use a comma in lists. We have kept these ‘and’ and any other Greek words that we could,
even if they are not ‘English-teacher approved.’
    Angel see Messenger.
    Apostle is a transliterated word. The English equivalent would be ‘one sent’ with the meaning of ‘one sent on a mission.’ Apostle
has been kept when speaking of Jesus’ apostles. Ambassador is the other rendering of this Greek word and truly a better translation
of G652.
    Ambassador* see Apostle.
    Appointed* is G5087 which literally is ‘placed’ but we don’t use ‘placed’ that way in English. The other ‘appointed’ without the
* is from compounds of G5021 that means ‘set in rank’, i.e., ‘command or appoint.’
    Assuredly is also ‘amen’ which roughly means ‘so be it.’ Jesus said this (sometimes twice), at the beginning of his teachings.
G281.
    Baptism see Immersion.
    Be, is, are, was, were, being, been verbs are generally ‘helper words’ added to other English verbs, adjectives or rarely nouns,
to translate some Greek verbs. When they are not ‘helper words’ then they are from compounds of G1510 (‘be, is, was...’) and
sometimes but rarely G2192 (‘have, hold, help’) and G5225 (denoted as be*, is*, was*, were* being*; exist, possess).
    Because is probably the largest improvement in the MLV over all other translations. In translations dating from 1523 even to now,
the English word ‘for’ has been used for words that should have always been translated as ‘because,’ G473, G3754, or ‘because of,’
G1223, G1360, G1752, G5484. Another such bad ‘for’ translation is G5228, ‘on behalf of’. Jesus did not die for us; he died on behalf
of us. See For, also.
    Believe, belief, faith, faithful, entrust in verb, adjective, adverb, or noun forms, are some of those very few Greek words (G4100,
G4102, G4103) which carry more meaning than the English equivalent. These words also carry the meaning: ‘to obey,’ ‘to be
persuaded’, even the whole process of salvation as in Acts 19. In the Greek language, the antonym of ‘to believe’ is ‘to be
disobedient’ (G544). See John 3:36 for both words together in the same verse.
    Believe in literally means ‘believe into,’ in the majority of all places in the New Testament. A similar expression is found in Mat
28:19 ‘into the name’, Acts 2:38 ‘into the forgiveness’.
    Belt is impossible to contextually distinguish; it could be a simple belt, or a complex series of leather straps used to hold tools,
weapons, money or a belt of armor. The girdle (belt) was worn on the hips, or waist, or across the chest. G2223.
    Blessed* see Gracious* below also. G3107.
    Bowels are where the Greeks thought the emotions were born. This is where we get expressions such as ‘desires of the heart,’ ‘gut
feeling,’ ‘nervous stomach’ and so on. G4698.
    Brethren is specifically ‘brothers’ but used more often to describe kinfolk in the N.T., whether by family ties or by the blood of
Jesus. Though translated from a Greek masculine noun, G80, the word includes males and females in context.
    Bring* and other verb forms, can be translated as ‘lead,’ G71 and its compounds. This was done primarily for concordance look-
ups.
    By is the literal from G5259 ‘hypo’ (also ‘under’); all others are the last choice of substitutes for the Dative case or various
prepositions because we just don’t speak the way the literal would be rendered. The interesting fact from this is that ‘by faith’ or ‘by
the faith’ was never truly ‘God said’. Oh well, the theologians will have to adjust.
    Call* and other verb forms are from G3004 (say, speak) and might be better as ‘is spoken of as’ or ‘is spoken to be’ and is
different from the compounds of the synonyms of G2564 (invited, called, surnamed) and G3687 (is named). All ‘called’ words used


8
by other various translations from the Greek words for ‘summon’ or ‘shout out’ have been rendered properly in the MLV. So every
time you see ‘called’ it can be ‘invited’ in the MLV same as with all the Greek compound words.
    Centurion*, used in Mark, is simply the Latin version of the word since he wrote to a Gentile audience.
    Centurions were military commanders of over 100 soldiers. They were highly esteemed individuals of society. (G2763, Latin root;
G1543, Greek.)
    Charity in the MLV does not mean ‘money.’ It may include money but literally means ‘good, merciful or kind acts.’ G1654
       Christ is a transliterated Greek noun G5547, used like an adjective, that would translate as ‘anointed’ or ‘anointed one’; Messiah
is the Hebrew translation.
    Church, see Congregation* below.
    Class (a noun) is the priestly service limited to a stated series of days. G2183. This is not to be confused with ‘class’ (a verb),
which is found at 2 Cor. 10:12. G1469.
    Cohort is a Roman military term used to describe a group of 600 soldiers. G4686.
    Come* and its other verb forms, would literally be ‘become’ or possibly ‘come to be’ but we just don’t speak that way. G1096.
    Coming (as in Second Coming), G3952, has been translated more properly as ‘presence.’
    Commanders were military commanders of over 1000 soldiers. G5506
    Congregation(s)* was the original translation by Tyndale in the first English translation from the Greek and then later changed
to ‘church’ by the Reformed Protestants in the Geneva Bible, and is a man-made word. The word ‘church’ was then perpetuated by
the Catholic Church and Church of England up until today and is now used in most translations simply because of tradition. This man-
made tradition has been used over the centuries to promote a ‘church’ rather than the Lord’s ‘congregation’ of believers. The word
in context is not a name but a description of ownership, or simply a local congregation located in some area. The word could be
translated ‘assembly.’ In Modern English, most think of ‘church’ as a building. The original Greek word, even in the Bible, carries
no special reverence. It is used to describe Jews, a mob, a local congregation, and the congregation of faithful, obedient believers
worldwide as in Matthew 16:18, Acts 2:47, called the one body in Eph. 4:1-6, Eph. 5:23 and others. Some have followed the
etymology, not its daily use, as ‘the called out’. This would be like saying a ‘pineapple’ is an ‘apple produced by a pine tree.’ The
word was in use in all Greek writings and meant some form of ‘leaving your home to congregate elsewhere, generally in public for
town announcements.’ (G1577).
    Consequently* is used to translate a couple Greek particles, G686 and G687. Consequently is not exactly ‘therefore’ in English.
It means that the previous statement is probably so or will become so.
    Container(s). The Bible uses Hebrew and Greek measurements, such as ‘cor’ which is a measurement of volume equal to about
90 gallons. We rendered these words as volume + the word ‘container.’ For example, ‘a ninety-gallon-container.’This was done so
we would not have to footnote every mention of these words; see Luke 16:7.
    Covenant(s)* can be translated as ‘agreement,’ ‘contract,’ ‘testament’ or ‘will’ as in the expression ‘Last Will and Testament.’
The underlying Greek word, G1242 and its compounds were translated uniformly as ‘covenant’ because ‘testament’ has no verb forms
in English. It could refer to the Old or New Testament or Covenant, or just a simple agreement, depending on the context. The Old
Testament law was until the death of Jesus and the New Testament law is after His death (see Hebrews 9-10 and Galatians 4:4). The
entire letter to the Hebrews deals with why Christians are no longer bound by the laws or traditions of the Old Testament. The events
recorded in the Gospels and the first chapter of Acts were actually part of the Old Covenant with God.
    Cubit is a forearm’s length. About 20-21 inches depending of which cubit measurement was common to that area. G4083.
    Die*, died* literally translated are ‘ended.’ G5053.
    Deacon(s) see footnote in 1 Timothy 3.
    Denarius is a coin of the Roman currency system which we have retained in the MLV translation. Plural is denarii. The various
other denominations are given here a rough comparison to Modern Day American currency.
    1. A denarius was equivalent to a day’s wage of the normal working class. It was a silver coin with Caesar’s face on it. G1220.
    2. Two drachmas was worth about 4 denarius, translated as ‘four-denarii.’ G1323.
    3. A lepton was a bronze coin, translated as ‘bronze-coin.’ Two of these is equal to an Assarion or Quadran which are copper coins
worth the cost of a dove or two sparrows, which is about a couple mouthfuls of food. Assarion and Quadran are translated as ‘copper-
coin.’ About 50 cents in US money. G3016.
    4. Mina which is translated as ‘200 denarius-coin’ is about 80% of a year’s salary in modern terms. In context it probably meant
a whole years wage. G3414.
    5. Slater was a coin equal to two drachmas or four denarii, translated as ‘four-denarii coin.’ G4715.
    6. Talant is not a coin but actually about 75 pounds of silver. Equal to about 1 million dollars in US money today which is roughly
6000 denarii coins. Talant has nothing to do with the English word ‘talent’ which was how the Greek word, G5007, was erroneously
transliterated in various other translations. This has lead to much confusion and is kept in other translations due to tradition.
    Devil was changed to ‘the Slanderer’ in the 2013 version, is back in 2015. The Greek word is an adjective used as a noun, a
transliteration of Hebrew, which has a perfect English equivalent ‘a slanderer.’ This Greek word is where we got ‘diabolical.’ The
Bible even uses the Slanderer and the Adversary (previously rendered Satan) together in Rev. 12:9 and 20:2.
    Different as it occurs six times in the MLV is from the Greek word, G2087, which is translated as ‘other’ or ‘another.’ In context,
it might mean something added as opposed to something different or opposite.


                                                                                                                                       9
    Disobedience* is the result of a ‘refusal to hear,’ or more subtly a refusal to take in what you hear. G3876. The other disobedience
(without the *) is the end result of ‘disbelieve.’ G543.
    Divine* is the only ‘divine’ that literally comes from the base word ‘God.’ G2304 and G2316.
    Do, does, did, are always a supplied word in the MLV 2020 upward, but not marked as such. Do, Does, Did, are used primarily
in questions or with the words, Not or Never.
    Do*, does*, doing*, did* are all from G4160 (mostly) and its synonym G4238 or compound words from these Greek words. The
‘do’ word can be translated as ‘practice’. Many false teachings and poor Bible knowledge stems from the non-use of the word
‘practice’ in the KJV and ASV translations.
    Fallen-asleep was used by Jesus and then Paul to mean dead or death in most instances. G2837.
    For is a preposition that has no true Greek equivalent. ‘To’ is the literal translation in all places in the Modern Literal Version.
Asterisk (*) versions are listed below. The conjunction ‘for’ used in other translations, which means ‘because, because of, in or on
behalf of,’ are translated as such in the MLV.
    *For represents the Greek preposition G1519 (eis), that is literally translated as ‘into,’ ‘to’ or ‘toward.’ It never means ‘because
of.’ No translation has ever translated ‘eis’ as ‘because of.’ Sometimes ‘leading toward’ works very well to get the meaning across
and has been used by many translations in some places. This preposition expresses forward action in the Greek verb where the English
word ‘for’ can be used with verbs of actions past or future. Again, all Greek words in the Modern Literal Version that mean ‘because’
are translated as ‘because.’
    For* represents the Greek word G1063 (gar). It is a conjunction with no exact English equivalent. It is a mild form of ‘because.’
    Forever, forevermore represent idiom of literally ‘into the ages’ and ‘into the ages of the ages’.
    Forgive* a verb is from the verb form of the Greek noun translated as ‘favor’ or ‘grace.’ G5483
    Fornication is from the Greek word G4202 (pornia), which means any premarital or extramarital sexual acts between two or more
people. It also means prostitution with its Greek base word meaning ‘sell.’ It does not in any way mean lust. It means physical sex,
including all variations of physical sex. This word can never be translated properly as ‘immorality’ or ‘sexual immorality’ as many
translations have it wrongly.
    Fruit(s)* is from the lesser number of the 2 Greek words. Both are used as literal fruit and one’s actions. G1079b, G2590.
    Furlong is 1/8 of a mile in English. But in the MLV it is from G4218 (stadium), which is 1/8 of a Roman mile 607 ft. (53 ft. less
than the modern furlong).
    Gentiles is also translated as ‘nations.’ The word means all nations which are not Israel or all people who are not Jews. G1484.
    Gift*, Gifts* are G5496, another noun form of the Greek noun, G5485, translated as ‘favor’ or ‘grace.’
    Gird and its verb forms, means to put on your belt, the final act of dressing yourself for the public or for a job (see Belt also).
G2224.
    Good* is literally ‘well.’ G2095 and compounds. The other ‘good’ (no *) are actually two synonyms. Good in general and good
outwardly. G0018 and G2570.
    Good-news is simply just ‘good news’ or used to mean Jesus and His teaching in general (1Co 15:1-4; 2Th 1:8, etc.). Originally
in the MLV, the Greek word was translated as ‘gospel’ in the religious context and ‘good news’ in other contexts but was adopted
as ‘good-news’ throughout in 2013 in order not to ‘commentate’ in the Word. G2098.
    Gracious* is the translation of G2128. Traditionally, in other translations, the word ‘blessed’ was an adjective in all the places
that would have read something along the lines of: ‘Blessed be God.’ ‘Fortunate’ be God, is craziness. ‘Happy’ be God, is again
craziness. God is surely not ‘happy’ with us.
    Guardian* is a non-legal term, a nanny, tutor, house servant, babysitter or a combination of all. A bond-servant or hired person
who specifically helped raise and teach the children. The other guardian is the legal type ‘guardian’.
    Have, has when connected to a past tense verb, though marked as supplied, technically are not. These are to help your mind see
the difference between perfect tense and past tense; ‘has gone’ would be ‘went’, if English were perfect.
    Heart(s)* is literally the intestines. The Greeks thought emotions were born there, in the way we often feel emotions in our gut.
G4698.
    Hell is from two different Greek synonyms which were the common names for the trash dump that was always on fire outside the
city, called Gehenna by the Jews and Tartarus by the Greeks. They used the same terms to describe the deepest, darkest, hot realms
of Hades where the most evil people were cast after dead to suffer punishment, in English that is Hell. G1067, G5020 a verb “throw
into Hell (Tartarus, one time 2Pe 2:4).” From a bible standpoint Hades is where all go at death, paradise or flame, Luke 16, Mar 9:43-
50. Tartarus is where the heavenly messengers who sinned are now. At the judgment the ‘flame side’ of Hades and Tartarus will be
cast into Gehenna, i.e., Hell.
    Helper* is from a Greek masculine noun, G3875, always capitalized. It is a ‘person called to help.’
    Hosanna is a Hebrew word meaning ‘Save me, I pray.’ or ‘Please deliver me.’
    Helper words, are words added to help translate certain Greek tenses, moods, cases, person, direction, timing or intensity into
English; they are not supplied words.
    Infant(s) may also mean a child of some age who is a minor in the legal sense; especially in Gal 4. G3516
    In-order-that is a better and more meaningful translation of G2443. See also That* and similar *That below.
    Immerse* or dipping and all its verb, noun and adjective forms are the translation of the Greek verb, G0907 (baptizo), and its


10
Greek variations (immersion*, immerser*), which all mean to submerge completely. In 1999, until baptism was changed to
immersion in about 2002, over 75% of the comments for revision of the Modern Literal Version from readers or visitors to the
Christian Library were ‘make baptism immersion.’ This word has a perfect English equivalent and so immersion has been used. For
a Bible definition read Romans 6:1-6. The Greek word was common to the Greeks and was used to describe a ‘bath,’ ‘washing
dishes,’ ‘ceremonial washings (always plural)’ and ‘Christian baptism.’ See Mark 7:4,8; Mark 16:16, Colossians 2:12-14, 1 Peter
3:21, etc. This word never meant ‘shower.’ There is a Greek word, G4472, for ‘sprinkling,’ G4472 (base word ‘rain-o’), and it is also
used in the New Testament.
    Indeed* (if indeed) is a conditional particle (G1437b and G1512). The real interesting one is the indeed (G3303) without an
asterisk and its use with ‘but’ G1161 in comparative statements.
    Iota (subscript) and serif are the smallest punctuation or accent marks of Greek. G2503.
    Irreproachable, G410, and Unimpeachable, G423, are both in the qualifications of Lord’s earthly congregation’s leadership,
described in various Bible versions and locations within as: elders, bishops, overseers, pastors, shepherds, presbyters (always plural).
These words do not translate well into English. They are simply a description of a person not under an accusation by an enemy or
legal system or better as under any accusation for that matter, this person is blameless, guiltless and has an impeccable reputation.
    Jesus or Joshua, James or Jacob, Mary or Maria or Miriam, are places where a Greek word could have represented one's Greek
or Hebrew name. We represent different people by different names; 'Mary' being the only exception because of Mat 27:61 and 7 total
'Mary' named people in the N.T.
    Keep in the MLV is one of those very few Greek words, G5083 and compounds, which carry more meaning than the English
word. The word carries with it: ‘to guard’ and/or ‘to watch over.’ ‘Keep’ the commandments would be to ‘guard’ them from harm
too.
    Koine Greek is the language of the New Testament, it was not even known to exist before the 1880's. All translators and reference
books (Strong’s Dictionaries for a really good example) written before then were based on the idea that all Greek is the same Greek
from Homer to that time with little variations even as the language changed from use over the centuries.
    Lie and its other verb forms are all related to ‘falsehood.’ The MLV uses ‘laying’ and ‘laid’ for transitive and intransitive verbs
of ‘lay’, better for a 13 year old and second English speaking people, plus concordance look-ups. In context it may be hard for even
English teachers to know for sure what the expression ‘lie in opposition’ actually means without the adjustment to ‘lay in opposition.’
    Like is literally ‘as.’ It was common to their language, but comes across as slang in English. G5613.
    Likewise* is G5615, a purely literal translation would be ‘as the same’ (i.e., likewise, similarly), and is marked more as a way
to show it is not the other likewise which is from G3668 (similar).
    Loins is literally the hips or hip areas.
    Love* and its other verb forms, are words meaning Christian love. The Greeks had different words for different kinds of love,
unlike English. This word is G25 (agapao). This word in religious writings had an intensified meaning, sacrificial love. The same
Greek spoken outside of the Bible or Christian writings, ‘love of people’ or simply ‘like.’
    Make*, makes*, made*, making* are simply the rendering of G4160 (poieo), and a few of its compounds. All other renderings
of ‘make’ wording are where the word ‘make’ is added to another English verb or noun to better translate a Greek word into English.
    Master* is simply marked to show G1988 used in Luke 5-17 vs. G1203 used elsewhere.
    May, Might, Should see Subjunctive Mood in ‘Verbs Tenses Moods’ section.
    Messenger is simply transliterated as ‘angel’ in many translations, G32. We have opted to translate it rather than transliterate. Only
context can determine if the messenger was from God or man or the devil.
    Minister* with its other verb and noun forms are words from G3008-G3011, these are to describe a type of servant whose service
is more public vs. the domestic servant, or bondservant who are house or estate workers and the bondservant who serve who owns
his bond. Most translation just make these all ‘serve’ and ‘servant’ and do not take in consideration the different Greek words and
the slight differences.
    Never would be best rendered as ‘in absolutely no way!’ an emphatic no! or not! but is just way too wordy to fit into most verses.
Never is often 2 negatives side by side. When never occurs with the subjunctive mood verb as in, ‘should never,’ it does not mean
‘will not.’ Instead, there is a slight possibility this could happen.
    Obey*, obedient*, obedience are G5218 and 5219. It is related to listening obediently to someone with authority. For example,
a soldier listening to and obeying his commanding officer or children to their parents, as in: ‘Children, obey* your° parents.’ The other
‘obey’ and ‘obedient’ words, G3980, G3982, come from the same root word as ‘believe.’ (See Believe).
    Offend and Offense literally means to ‘snare,’ ‘stumble’ or a ‘cause to stumble.’ G4634 and G4625.
    Only begotten is from the Greek word, G3439, which literally means ‘only born of a mother’ (Classical Greek of the LXX) or
‘only born of a father’ (God)’ (Koine Greek of the N.T.). This clarifies the statement in the Bible ‘we are all sons of God through
Christ Jesus’. All other theologies and various other translations about G3439 end up creating a Bible contradiction.
    Permit*, permits*, permitted*, are from G2010. Literally to turn over the control to, authorize. Authorize was just too strange
in context for places that are more of the “may I please” or “to please you”.
    Present* is a different Greek word (G3918) from the other more common ‘present’ (Greek compounds of G2476).
    Prostitute is the best English word we have that is not vulgar to describe a sexually promiscuous individual or a prostitute or both,
primarily female. Context is not always certain as to which meaning is applicable either. G4204.


                                                                                                                                          11
     Rabbi and Rabboni both mean teacher in the Hebrew language. G4461 and G4462.
     Ravening is a adjective (same as ‘ravenous’) and a verb that is a variation of ‘seize.’ G724-G727, G4884. Ravening is more of
a hunger to seize more especially what is not yours. This word in 2018 replaces: ravenous, plundering, swindling or swindler(s).
     Regeneration* is the restoration of a thing to its pristine state, its renovation, as a renewal or restoration of life after death as in
the death of the Law, the birth of Jesus’ Law or death of our previous life to live as new creations. In some past versions: rebirth.
G3824
     Recognize is also translated as ‘fully know’ or ‘know fully.’ It is the reader’s choice of which they prefer, since they are
interchangeable. G1921.
     Rejected* has more meaning to it in the Greek and is best thought of as: ‘they tested it, they did not like it and so they rejected
it.’ G593.
     Repent, repentance are terms which mean to change your heart or perception with your actions, to ‘do a 180,’ to have an
afterthought and then fix it. G3539.
     Rise* and Raise* with other verb forms are literally ‘stand up,’ but that poses a problem since we do not use that idiom in English,
G0450.
     Separate* and other verb forms, are from ‘border or boundary’ which would be ‘border off’ or the lighter meaning of ‘quarantine
off.’ The other ‘separate’ is ‘make room between.’ G0873.
     Serve*, Servant* and other verb forms, are the verb form of bondservant, which is best described as to serve in or under contract
of someone which could be voluntarily or not. Moses was a bondservant, which is how he gained his wife. Bondservants could be
slaves, people paying off a debt or hired servants under a contract. The specific type of servant cannot be determined, even in context.
G1398.
     Should, May, Might see Subjunctive Mood in the ‘Verb, Tense and Moods’ section.
     Sold*, selling* are G4097 and is only used in the sense of ‘sold for money.’ The other sell, sold (G4453) can also be barter or
exchange.
     Sound* is also translated as ‘healthy.’ G5198.
     Spirit G4151, has been capitalized following the ASV. However, capitalization and punctuation are not features of the Greek,
and may be ignored if believed to be incorrect.
     Spirit(s)* is literally ‘soul.’ G5590. ‘Breath of life’ and its compounds occur only in Philippians 2.
     Standard* is like a U.S. yardstick. A round straight piece of wood or metal used as a standard of measurement to measure the
length or distance of something. It is used figuratively in most instances of the New Testament. G2583.
     Stewardship means to manage the house or household, or to manage the affairs of others. G3622.
     Than though marked as supplied, is most often a translation of a genitive Greek word when next to a comparative or superlative
adjective or adverb; a Greek idiom. As an example ‘he is greater of me’ would be ‘he is greater than I.’
     *That is G3705 which is stronger than Modern English ‘that.’ It means ‘in-order-that’ but not as strong as the word In-order-that
or that*, listed below.
     That* in Greek is G2443 (hina), which literally means ‘in-order-that’ but is just too wordy for some English sentences.
     *That* was used to replace a Greek idiom that reads ‘into the thing to verb’ (G1519 (eis) + G3588 neutered (to) + an infinitive
verb), occasionally G4314 instead of G1519.We have converted all of these idioms to a subjunctive like form, ‘*that* {the subject}
should/may {the verb}.’ *That* can be read as ‘in-order-that’ if this makes more sense.
     The (definite article) occurs in Greek same as in English with one major exception: ‘the’ is used with proper nouns. ‘Paul’ is
literally ‘the Paul.’ We render these in all places where English will allow. The inspired writers could have left ‘the’ out and it still
would have been good Greek grammar, but they didn't. G3588.
     There* is simply a way to show G847 vs. G1563 and its compounds.
     View is a stronger form of ‘see’ or ‘look.’ It means to ‘view as a spectator’ or to ‘view from the side lines.’ View implies that there
is more attention being given to what is being viewed. G2334.
     Travel, can be a short distance like ‘travel down the throat’ or travel around the world. G4198.
     Unfaithful, disbelieve, unbeliever and all verb, noun or adjective forms of these or similar in the MLV could be translated as
‘disobey’ or ‘is disobedient.’ Any Greek word compound of G1 & any compound of G3982.
     When, while, after are helpers words used to help create English like verb tenses from Greek participles, Luke’s infinitives and
mixed tense sentences. If you place yourself in the sentence, you can understand the action and why the Greeks wrote this way.
     While* is used in translating a Greek idiom (in the thing to verb).
     With* is literally ‘in’ or ‘at’ or ‘among,’ G1722 (en).
     Wormwood may be a person or thing, and an actual substance which is bitter tasting. G894.
     You°, your°, yours° are the plural forms of ‘you’ and ‘your.’

                          Preface to the Modern Literal Version 2021 TOC
                                            Quick Overview
   God wrote His New Covenant with man in a language called Koine Greek. The Modern Literal
Version uses the Majority Greek Text (The New Testament in the Original Greek, Byzantine
Textform 2018, Compiled and Arranged by Maurice A. Robinson and William Pierpont).
   Only three primary methods exist to translate a foreign language. The first is to translate each
word, in a literal word for word fashion, keeping the original word order (ISBN: 978-1973921967).
This, when combined with the Greek Bible is called a ‘Greek interlinear’ even though most of them
attempt to be a ‘translation’ especially the pathetic ‘reverse interlinear’ of recent times. This will be
our, not yet published, ‘New Koine Greek Textbook VI.’
   The Modern Literal Version is the second type of ‘literal’ translation also called a ‘word-for-word’
translation (descriptions ‘coined’ centuries ago). This sounds like an interlinear, but is not the same
and the two should not be confused with each other. (This difference is where all those who talk
about translations, who have never worked on a published translation, are misled and mislead
others.) In a literal translation each word and phrase is uniformly rendered, Greek idioms (all
languages have them, Greek has plenty of them) are carefully translated uniformly. The Greek parts
of speech are rearranged as they would be in typical English: subject, verb, object, indirect object,
and punctuation is added. Greek is extremely choppy and supplied words are needed to have an
‘English like flow’ to them. (In particular, the word “the” often needs to be added.) Supplied words
should always be identified in all literal translations. This way the reader can always omit them if
desired. Now for the extremely rare places (the unskilled think idioms are such places) where literal
is too choppy for most English readers, two sub-methods exist, which are either paraphrasing or
adding supplied words. The MLV uses the latter. Supplied words are written in italics in the MLV
text. No truly literal translation can be ‘English teachers approved’ without paraphrasing!
   The third translation method, and the most common one especially in the past 30 years, is to
paraphrase the Greek into English. These are easy to spot because they read like a newspaper or a
story book and have no supplied words marked in them. They are ‘English teacher’ approved
wording and sentence structure. English teachers are more the translators of these translations than
Greek scholars. This type of translation is known by various names, such as dynamic equivalence,
essentially literal, free style, thought-for-thought, better than a word-for-word, and so on. The
paraphrased versions actually account for more than 95% of all Bible translations ever made. We
understand the value of a paraphrase for those looking for a Bible that reads as easily as a newspaper,
and want the translators to interpret the Bible for them. But this type should never be used as a study
tool. A sad commentary is paraphrased foreign language documents are acceptable only in fiction,
story telling and churches.
   However, we feel strongly that thought-for-thought introduces way too many editorial opinions.
They are sometimes better described as ‘opinion for opinion’ because each time they are proofread
by another person(s) or English teacher, more personal beliefs are exchanged for the Word of God.
We desire to see a Bible that reproduces the original Greek Bible into modern English as faithfully
as possible with as little editorial bias as possible. One way to look at it is like this: If there was a


14
court case with a key document as evidence, and this document was in a foreign language, would a
‘essential literal’ translation be acceptable? No! The document we are talking about here is the ‘Last
Will and Testament’ of our Lord Jesus. Did you know that paraphrased bible versions are generally
10% smaller than literal ones in the number of words they contain? They are often watered down and
those places that are disputed by the various religious groups will always match the beliefs of their
translators, or those controlling the money behind the translation. The goal of everyone who has
worked on the Modern Literal Version has been to keep any form of commentary or paraphrasing
out of the translation as much as is humanly possible.
    The MLV stays free from theological concerns and traditions by translating the text as literally as
possible while retaining modern language and readability. The ‘Open Source’ approach (discussed
more later) is a far superior ‘checks and balance’ system. In roughly 30 years only one person
recommended an ‘indoctrination.’ People don’t even try because the next person would just remove
it.
    The MLV is NOT under the control of any: denomination, publishing company, government,
college or software vendor and is not the current work of any either; that is why it can be sold for no
profit. The Open Source method takes the control from those who love money and power and gives
the power back to ALL Christians who want to have the ‘purest’ Word of God available. The only
uninspired traditions kept in the MLV are punctuation and capitalization, chapter and verse numbers,
and the not God breathed non-chronological book order.
                                                 History
    The MLV was the first translation to use the power of the computer (an 8086), and absolutely
would have been impossible before the computer age and WordPerfect and its macro abilities
(special thanks to Corel Corporation).
    The ‘Modern Literal Version New Testament’ came about in 1987 due to a young Christian’s goal
to find an accurate Modern English translation from which to study. The New American Standard
contradicted itself in Matthew 5:17 and Ephesians 2:15 for example. Almost all other Modern
English translations do not claim to be literal or word-for-word and most that make such a claim are
factually not! Concordance look-ups in all existing translations present non-uniform Greek word
renderings and this too was an issue of concern.
    A Bible Study Group, of which this new Christian was a part, was actively doing topical, English
and Greek word studies with their Bibles and ‘Englishman’s Greek Concordances.’ They discovered
that the ASV was the most accurate translation, and initially started a study Bible cross reference
section for it. Then an idea developed to do a slight revision of the 1901 American Standard Version
for the public domain, code named ‘ASV3'. Eventually, these ideas were dropped due to too many
problems: the underlying Greek text, massive footnoting, archaic words, inconsistent Greek word
translations, poor verb tensing, etc.
    Then a better idea grew, let computers and programing do the work, then let humans proofread
and edit the result, so the creation of a modern (English) literal version (which later became its name)
was born. A group of workers, teachers, scholars, computer owners and programmers, who believe
in the total authority and inspiration of the Bible, have devoted time, advice, software, money and
work to the project. Now, over 30 years later, at least 66 experts in the original language have
contributed work needed to make this translation a reality. Many others, about 430, 9 computer
technicians, 40+ programmers, and another 6500 or so in all the MLV, Greek and other discussion


                                                                                                       15
groups on Facebook and various Christian forums have also helped with large amounts of
proofreading, improvements to English comprehension, double-checking Greek definitions,
compounds, synonyms, Greek concordance look-ups, accuracy checks and/or other menial (but
extremely essential) tasks. Many thousands of corrections have been received via FTP, snail mail,
telephone, chat, and e-mail, over the years. 99% of us have never met in person and know each other
only by a nickname from email or chat. We will never be able to express our gratitude enough to all
of these people, living and deceased.
   There has been nothing traditional about the MLV and our unorthodox methods are what produced
the ‘world’s most accurate’ English New Testament. A side note, as the MLV went thru stages of
growth an English Concordance, Greek Lexicon and Greek Concordance, Analytical Greek Lexicon
and Greek Word Concordance were also created for tracking purposes, now called the ‘New Koine
Greek Textbook Series’ and also available in print and electronic formats.
                                 The Open Source Bible Translation
   The Modern Literal Version New Testament is considered ‘completed,’ although it has been open
for revision by anyone since 1998. No bible should have ever been ‘closed.’ We doubt to ever need
to make another major update because in 2017 very few ‘Thus saith the Greek’ recommendations
were submitted but then a massive rechecking of verb tenses in the summer of 2018 rendered the
2019. Further computerized quality checks has now produced the 2021 update. Our utmost desire
is to have a translation that has no translation errors in it and we believe that the best way to produce
an error-free translation is to keep it open to the public in the same manner as ‘open-source software’
is to programmers. Our original attempt to follow traditional methods of translation failed; they
always have! Since 1999, we have found no better way than our ‘open’ translation idea to achieve
this goal and the use of computer programming for uniformity and accuracy with millions of possible
proofreaders. Absolutely anyone in the world, any Christian affiliation, is able to contribute to the
translation, including, the several million who have visited the Christian Library and the official
MLV web site. You, too, may make recommendations or help in other ways, with either Greek or
English type proofreading. If the recommendations warrant another update next year, we will do one
each year in printed form and a Kindle edition. Free electronic versions are updated periodically
throughout the year, as needed on the web sites and Facebook. The ‘cutting edge’ update is always
the BOLD Letter Edition PDF at:
http://www.ModernLiteralVersion.org/bibles/MLV/MLVBL.pdf
   As far as we know, this ‘open’ translation idea is unique to the MLV. You are invited to
participate in helping to remove 600+ years of error from the Bible. There is even a Facebook group
at https://www.facebook.com/groups/MLVbible that now has many offshoots. All who have helped
have contributed to further the readability or accuracy of this translation or simply have double
checked previous efforts. Now is the time for the Bible to be placed in the hands of everyday
Christians who have no agendas. If you can suggest any corrections please send an email to
mlvbible@gmail.com with subject line: ‘MLV’. Please always download the newest (link above)
to check it, before submitting a ‘recommendation.’ We want an error-free translation! Thank you in
advance.
                                   General Translation Notes TOC
   The Greeks wrote in present tense to give the reader the feeling of ‘being there’ and so this


16
translation leaves present tense unchanged. It is common that the Greek speaking writers start with
a past event (some point in time), go to present, and then onward even to future in a few places. Even
when they wrote in past tense they still wanted the ‘reader’ in the action. You will gain valuable
insights if you put yourself in the ‘action.’ We hope this will also help you feel closer to our Lord
and God. Sad how many theologians have missed this simple fact for centuries and have complicated
simple Greek translation.
   G1-G5624 are from the Strong’s Numbering System, are used often here because Unicode is not
supported in various conversion processes. Sorry that these annoy you Greek Scholars, but 99% of
the people who want to look up the Koine Greek listings in the MLV will be using them.
   Paragraphs are used in this translation with no credence given to chapter or verse numbers since
verse formats, chapter titles or other special formatting often takes ideas out of context (for example,
see Mark 8:34 to 9:1). Double-spaced paragraphs are attempts to arrange sentences by subject.
Single-spaced paragraphs are for conversations or for sub-topics. We did not include subject
headings since we decided this would reflect opinions, and something not desirable even in the Word
of God.
   Single or double quotation marks are not used in this translation for conversations, since they are
not found in the original language, and adding them would be an area of opinion too often.
   We also do not capitalize pronouns that appear to be referring to God (‘Him,’ ‘He’ etc.). This is
to avoid inserting our opinion in the translation; the Greek Bible does not make these distinctions.
   Red Lettering or Bold Lettering (electronic or printed editions) is used for the words of Jesus,
God the Father and the Holy Spirit even in an indirect quote as in Acts 26. If you do not believe the
RED or BOLD should be used in a certain area, please ignore.
   Greek is participle crazy. A rather large number of participles are found in sentences; it is common
that a sentence contains no main verb, and one participle after another. We have added supplied
words in an effort to stay more literal and yet break these into smaller, more readable English
sentences. We have also keep these to one or two per sentence otherwise young people or non-native
English people will not understand the sentences.
   The curly brackets ({...}) offer additional information. They are blue in the Red Letter edition or
charcoal gray in the Bold Letter release. These contain:
     1. The Old Testament reference at the end of the verse, which may be an exact quote or a
paraphrase by the inspired writer, or simply the location of the historical event. Single quotes are
used at the beginning and end of actual quotes or paraphrases. We did not attempt to translate the
Greek in Old Testament quotes to match the Hebrew to English translations.
     2. We used a {T} to denote wording that is not found in the majority of manuscripts. Most of
these were early attempts to harmonize various events which were added into the King James
Version or maybe commentary that was added which later became part of the text by copyists. The
exception being, Acts 8:37 in which the last section ‘I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.’
was quoted in the late 2nd Century by Irenaeus, which predates almost all manuscripts, so 8:37 was
inserted back into the MLV text. 1Jn 5.7b-8a was put there from the Catholic Latin Bible and it is
not included.
     3. ‘Harmony of the New Covenant’ is a man-made study help and combines information from
the four books of Jesus’ life here on the earth and place the actual time that the letters were written
in the book of Acts and continue to the end of Revelation. (The Bible was not written in
Encyclopedia format. Not all information on any subject is generally all inclusive in any one area.)


                                             www.mlvbible.com                                         17
Here is an example of the ‘Great Commission’ or better ‘How to Make or Become a Disciple of
Christ’ and the way it is represented in the Modern Literal Version throughout Mark.
   Here is a combination of the passages listed below as an example, Mark is BOLD, Matthew is
black, Luke is italicized (the punctuation was fixed to attempt to make it easier to read in English).
   {Mar 16:15-18 and Mat 28:18-20 and Luk 24:46-47 Mountain in Galilee}
   And he said to them, While you* have traveled into all the world to all the nations, beginning
from Jerusalem to all creation, preach the good-news, make disciples of all the nations.
   He who believes (and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name)
and is immersed* (immersing* them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit), will be saved, teaching them to observe all things, as many things as I have commanded
you*, but he who disbelieves will be condemned.
   And behold, I am with you* all the days until the end of the earth.
             The original intentions and guidelines for the Modern Literal Version
   1. To translate the original Greek of the Bible, word-for-word, into English, then to further boost
the accuracy of the MLV, we translate the same Greek word into as few different English words as
is possible. We also do this for English words by not using the same English word for different
Greek words. Careful attention was paid to synonyms, antonyms, compound words and the few
Greek words which truly have multiple meanings. Greek has ‘shades of meaning’ no more than does
equal English words (a common misconception). One way to look at this is: if God wanted 10
different words used instead of one single Greek word, the inspired writers would have penned it that
way. The New Testament is its own best commentary when you see the same Greek word translated
into the same English word throughout. We call this ‘uniform and consistent’ translating and we
believe that we’re the first translation to ever attempt this and had the power of computers to
accomplish it. This form of translation is an extremely challenging task, and not one that many
translators would ever take the time to do, even though it is now possible to do with computers.
More information is in the ‘Wording Statistics’ section at the end or on the web site or in MySword
and e-Sword.
   2. The goal of the MLV was not to make it perfect everyday English, but to try to make it
understandable to the majority of English speaking people, while remaining literal, especially to
teenagers and 2nd speaking English people. Many sentences in the MLV start with conjunctions like
‘and,’ ‘but,’ ‘for’ and ‘because.’ This was so that we could split incredibly long sentences, some of
which were more than 50 words in length, into shorter ones as we were translating the text into
English. The Modern Literal Version is at about a 12-year old’s reading level.
   3. To translate some verses that have been misinterpreted for years by many religious groups, as
close as possible to the original language.
   4. To use italics for supplied words and use supplied words as opposed to paraphrasing. We want
people to see what we added.
   5. To translate the money and measuring systems of the Bible into some understandable form.
   6. To use ‘will’ for all future tenses, though it is not ‘teacher approved’ Modern English. It is the
way most English people speak.
   7. To use paragraph format. Verse format often takes meanings out of context or contributes
toward misinterpretations of the context.


18                                         www.mlvbible.com
   8. To use the more proper ‘may’ or ‘might’ for the subjunctive mood verbs. The ASV used
‘should’ and ‘shall.’ Shall is not considered ‘conditional’ in Modern English, but future tense. (See
more in the ‘Verb, Tenses, Moods’ section).
   9. To arrange the Greek word order into normal English word order of subject verb object (SVO).
Following Greek word order is not more literal or accurate; if we retained the Greek order it would
just be more like an interlinear without the Greek.
   10. To footnote or explain in the ‘Definitions’ section places where a literal translation could not
be understood or an idiom used by the common Greeks. For example: ‘into the ages’ is an idiom for
‘forever;’ ‘into the ages of the ages’ is ‘forevermore.’ (These are not as common as many people
would have you believe).
   11. To render active tense verbs as ‘is/are verb-ing’ to help show action. Many people wrongly
say the ‘-eth’ ending used in older translations meant continual action. It was simply the way they
spoke before the 1800's.
   12. To fix the preposition and conjunction problems that plague all translations. Our biggest fix
is the English word ‘for’ that was used even in the ASV for several Greek words which mean
‘because of,’ ‘because,’ ‘to,’ ‘ toward,’ ‘of,’ ‘in/on behalf of’ and a mild form of ‘because.’ The
MLV translated all Greek words that mean ‘because,’ ‘because of’ and ‘in/on behalf of’ as such. The
other meanings are shown by use of asterisks (*) with the two most common Greek words translated
as ‘for’ (‘eis,’ G1520 = *for and G1063 ‘gar’ = for*).
   13. To avoid inconsistencies caused by splitting up the translators and proofreaders into groups.
A typical translation may have 100 plus people but by the time you split them into 25 or more
committees the number of people in one particular book might be as little as 4 and those different
groups can cause stylistic and translation variations. Those who volunteer with the MLV tend to
work all the way through the New Testament, so in the MLV the total per book far exceeds any
committee type translation ever made.
   14. To include a Harmony of the New Testament with AD dates, which gives a person the ability
to read the New Testament straight through or in chronological order. (Start at Mark, then go to Acts:
The Book of Conversions.)
   15. When traditional renderings are not Greek, they will be translated properly. Oh well, and the
theologians will just have to adjust; (added in 2013 because we found us also following tradition).
   16. Translate words using their full translation even if a little too wordy in places to denote
differences between English wording used for different Greek wording. Two examples are: ‘together
with’ vs. ‘with’ (G4862 & its compounds); ‘in-order-that’ vs. ‘that’ (G2443 and its compounds).
   The 1987-1999 version, at roughly 95% completed, was formally U.S. copyrighted and placed into
the ‘Christian Library’ in June, 1999 at http://www.ChristianLibrary.org. In 2014, the MLV has an
official site http://www.ModernLiteralVersion.org. The Christian Library is a mirror site to deal with
most of the bandwidth issues (special thanks to ISCnetwork.com). Currently the MLV is 2016 (+75
yrs.) US Library of Congress Copyright http://www.ModernLiteralVersion.com is for future growth
in 2017.
   Finally, a challenge to all who think that another translation is more accurate to the original Greek
than the MLV: show us the correction needed! Please remember ‘thus saith the Greek’ not ‘my
version says.’ This translation needs to be judged by the Greek, not anything else!
In Christ,

                               English Words to one Greek Word TOC
   Less than 10% of the Greek words used in the N.T. have multiple meanings of which context
determines the proper word. These are words noteworthy to the average non-Greek student which
came from the same Greek word; enclosed together in (parentheses): (grace, favor), (complete,
mature; all verb, noun and adjective forms), (divorce, release), (false, lying; all adjective forms),
(patterns, examples), (choice, chosen), (corrupt, decay), (jealous, zealous), (comfort, encourage,
plead), (might, should), (gentiles, nations), (condemnation, judgement), (healthy, sound), (keep,
guard, observe), (lawsuit, judgement), (lust, O.T. desire), (pursue, persecute), (make ready, prepare),
(save, cure), (tempt, test), (tent, tabernacle), (way, road), (weak, sick), (witness, testify), (will, wish)
and the Greek synonym (will, plan),(‘age’ can be ‘world’), (non hyphenated ‘hold’ can be ‘have’)
(‘lead’ can be ‘bring’), (‘return’ can be ‘turn’ or ‘turn again’) (‘speech’ can be ‘word’), (‘toward’ can
be ‘to’ or ‘leading to’ even ‘to obtain’), (‘call’ or ‘called’ can be ‘invite’ or ‘invited’ in most
instances), (‘covenant,’ ‘testament’; though ‘testament’ is not used in the actual MLV’s text).
                                Greek History During N.T. Times TOC
   In the first century, the entire known world was under Roman rule and the universal language was
Koine Greek (common Greek). The language became dead two centuries later (nevermore to
change). Even though many have tried to make the Greek language ‘change’ with new theologies,
only translation principles have changed. For example, Koine Greek was not even known to be a
separate language from Greek until the 1800's.
   The New Testament makes mention of three different rulers of Judea under Greek authority named
Herod. Herod the Great reigned from 39 BC to 4 BC. He expanded the Temple to include the royal
family’s wing. His son Herod Archelaus reigned from 4 BC to 6 AD. Augustus judged him
incompetent and reorganized the territories under the other son, Herod Antipas from 6 AD to 39 AD.
   When you were called back to Rome, you were given the ‘suicide’ option or be killed.
   Jews did not speak to Samaritans or women in public (John 4). This is useful to know for
understanding parts of John.
   The soldiers of the Roman military were also the police. If a guard lost his prisoner(s), he and his
family were forfeited in exchange; that is why many guards committed suicide. By committing
suicide, their families would be spared. The jailer in Acts 16 was about to do this before Paul
shouted to him.
   Part of a day, to the Jews, equaled an entire day and night. In modern terms, the Bible indicates
that Jesus said he will be in the tomb three days and three nights (Mat 12:40), but this is by Jewish
thinking or custom. Jesus was buried Friday (Day of Preparation; Day 1). He was in the tomb from
6:00 PM Friday to 6:00 PM Saturday (The Sabbath; Day 2). He arose sometime around dawn Sunday
(the first day of the week; Day 3). The ‘ninth hour’ in those days is 3:00 PM in modern time. This
is also a different teaching along this line that God when he darkened the sun on Friday at noon,
made Friday (in the eyes of the Jews) 2 days.
   Women and bondservants under Roman rule had the same rights in court. A widow or single


woman without close male family was an easy target by just about anyone who wanted to take
advantage of her (James 1:27). Lydia and her group, in order to stay safe, probably maintained a
circle of protection in Acts 16.
   Respectable Christian women and those from a Jewish background covered their heads and long
hair because prostitutes of the time didn’t.

   Many congregations give the MLV to all the members and any visitor; yours should also. All have
grown thanks to having a purer, more understandable Word of God. Please point out the Simple
Reading Schedule to those who receive them, to help them read God’s Word, especially for the first
time. The MLV is the only translation we know to exist in which every word can be looked up in a
standard dictionary, and the proper meaning is ‘Bible’ correct. The MLV is written at about a 12
year-old’s reading level; even some ‘big’ bible words were simplified for teenagers and 2nd language
English foreigners.
   We want your input should you ever find a typo or a better Greek correction for the MLV . Please
check: www.modernliteralversion.org for a current PDF update and make sure the typo or fix has
not already been applied before submitting to mlvbible@gmail.com. Thank you in advance. As far
as we know, the MLV is the only Bible in print that wants such input.
                                            {{ Introduction to the Good News
   The first four books of the New Testament are traditionally called the gospels, a word which means ‘good news.’
These are four biographies about Christ Jesus, written to share the good news about His life, death, and resurrection.
Each of these four gospels was written to a different audience, and so each one has a slightly different approach—but
they are all accurate biographies of Christ Jesus. Matthew wrote his good- news to a Jewish audience, and so he included
several quotations from the Old Testament, showing that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah they had been waiting to
come. Mark wrote to a Roman audience, which liked their reading to be more action-oriented, so his account focuses
more on the actions of Jesus. Most scholars believe that Mark is written in chronological order. Luke wrote to a more
detail-oriented audience, and his account is filled with historical and geographical details that were not included by the
other writers. John wrote to a general audience, guiding them to faith in Jesus as the Son of God. John wrote his account
much later than the others, so he concentrates more on aspects of Jesus’ life not mentioned previously. It makes a great
supplement to the other three. All who lived during this time of these books were still under the Law of Moses, Galatians
4:4. Jesus’ teachings during this time were to introduce the Jews to the covenant promised to Abraham completed by
Jesus’ death, Hebrews 9:16-17.}}

                                          {{ Introduction to Matthew 45-52 AD
    The book of Matthew is better called ‘The Good News According to Matthew.’ The writer is traditionally thought
to be Matthew (Levi), a tax collector whom Jesus called to be an apostle (Matthew 9:9-13; 10:3). This biography of Jesus
the Christ was written primarily for Jews, to convince the Jews that Jesus is the prophesied Messiah which is why
Matthew spent so much time showing how Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies— things that would have been
irrelevant to a non-Jewish audience. A key verse in Matthew is 5:17 where Jesus states He came to fulfill the law.
Matthew presents the teachings of Jesus in large sections and discusses the works of Jesus (emphasizing His power).
Jesus’ speech to the Jews in what is commonly called the ‘Sermon on the mount’ is a contrast between the Law of Moses
vs. New Testament Law, outward vs. inward actions. This section contains the most misquoted verse in the bible by
sinners 7:1, ‘do not judge.’ But Christians have read John 5:30 and 7:24 and have seen many examples of Jesus and the
inspired writers judging (or condemning) others or their practices. Beginning with the birth of Jesus, Matthew recounts
how Jesus lived a perfect life under the Law of Moses (Gal 4:4), and how His death would set the stage for a New
Testament (Covenant) under which men could be saved. The final instructions given by Jesus after His resurrection, in
this biography, are on how disciples are made: by teaching and immersing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit (Matthew 28:18-20). After the list of apostles in Acts 1:13, Matthew disappears from the history of the New
Testament.}}

          The book of lineage of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: 1:2 Abraham
fathered Isaac; and Isaac fathered Jacob; and Jacob fathered Judah and his brethren; 1:3 and Judah
fathered Perez and Zerah from Tamar; and Perez fathered Hezron; and Hezron fathered Ram; 1:4 and
Ram fathered Amminadab; and Amminadab fathered Nahshon; and Nahshon fathered Salmon; 1:5
and Salmon fathered Boaz from Rahab; and Boaz fathered Obed from Ruth; and Obed fathered
Jesse; 1:6 and Jesse fathered David, the king.
     And David, the king, fathered Solomon from the widow of Uriah; 1:7 and Solomon fathered
Rehoboam; and Rehoboam fathered Abijah; and Abijah fathered Asa; 1:8 and Asa fathered
Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat fathered Jehoram; and Jehoram fathered Uzziah; 1:9 and Uzziah
fathered Jotham; and Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah; 1:10 and Hezekiah fathered
Manasseh; and Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah; 1:11 and Josiah fathered
Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the exile of Babylon.
      1:12
           And after the exile of Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Shealtiel; and Shealtiel fathered
Zerubbabel; 1:13 and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud; and Abiud fathered Eliakim; and Eliakim fathered
Azor; 1:14 and Azor fathered Sadoc; and Sadoc fathered Achim; and Achim fathered Eliud; 1:15 and
Eliud fathered Eleazar; and Eleazar fathered Matthan; and Matthan fathered Jacob; 1:16 and Jacob

Christ, were fourteen generations.

           Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: for* his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before
they came together, she was found holding a child in her womb {i.e., pregnant} from the Holy Spirit.
1:19
      Now Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man and not willing to disgrace her, planned to
divorce her secretly. 1:20 But when he had contemplated these things, behold, a messenger of the Lord
appeared to him according-to a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your
wife for* what was born {Or: conceived} in her is from the Holy Spirit. 1:21 Now she will be bearing a
son, and you will call his name Jesus, for* he will be saving his people from their sins. 1:22 Now this
whole thing has happened in-order-that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be
fulfilled, saying, 1:23 ‘Behold, the virgin will be holding a child in her womb {i.e., pregnant}, and will
be bearing a son, and they will call his name Immanuel’; which is, after being translated, ‘God with
us.’ {Isa 7:14, 8:8, 10} 1:24 Now having been awakened from his sleep, Joseph did* as the messenger
of the Lord commanded him and took his wife to him; 1:25 and did not know her intimately until
which time she bore her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus.

men {Persian Magi; v7 & v16} from the east came* into Jerusalem, 2:2 saying, Where is he who was born
the King of the Jews? For* we saw his star in the east and came to worship him. 2:3 Now after Herod

together all the high-priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring with them where the Christ
should be born.

out accurately the things concerning the young child. And whenever you° find him, report° to me,

away. And behold, the star, which they saw in the east, was preceding them until it came and stood
above where the young child was. 2:10 Now having seen the star, they rejoiced with extremely great
joy. 2:11 And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother. They fell down
and worshiped him. Having opened their treasures, they brought gifts of gold and frankincense and
myrrh to him. {Isa 60:6, Psa 72:10, 15} 2:12 And having been divinely-warned according-to a dream not

exceedingly furious, and sent forth soldiers and assassinated all the boys who were in Bethlehem,
and in all her borders, from two years and downward, according-to the time which he had
ascertained accurately with the wise-men. 2:17 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was
fulfilled, saying, 2:18 ‘A voice was heard in Ramah, mourning, and weeping, and much anguish,
Rachel weeping for her children. And she did not wish to be comforted, because they are not there.’

travel into the land of Israel, for* the ones seeking the young child’s life have died. 2:21 Now he raised
himself up and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of Israel. 2:22 But after

have no reward from your° Father, the one in the heavens.
     6:2
         Therefore, whenever you are doing* charity, do not sound a trumpet before you just-like the
hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the lanes, *that they may be glorified by men. Assuredly I am
saying to you°, They are fully having their reward. 6:3 But when doing* charity, do not let your left
hand know what your right hand is doing*, 6:4 *that your charity may be in secret, and your Father
who sees in secret will be repaying you openly himself.
     6:5
         And whenever you pray, do not be just-like the hypocrites, because they love to pray, standing
in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, *that they may appear devout to men. Assuredly
I am saying to you°, that they are fully having their reward. 6:6 But you, whenever you pray, enter into
your storeroom, and after you have locked your door, pray to your Father in secret, and your Father
who sees in secret will be repaying you openly. 6:7 And while praying, do° not be repetitious just-like
the Gentiles; for* they think that they will be heard in their many words. 6:8 Therefore, do° not be
similar to them, for* your° Father knows which things you° have need of before you° ask him.
    {The example prayer. The Lord’s prayer is for unity in John 17. Also see 6:11 note.}
     6:9
         Therefore, you°, pray° thus: our Father, the one in the heavens, let your name be made holy. 6:10
Let your kingdom come. Let your will happen as in heaven, also upon the earth. 6:11 Give our {F}
needful bread to us today. 6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. 6:13 And do
not bring us into temptation, but rescue us from the evil one, because it is your kingdom and the
power and the glory, forever. Amen. 6:14 For* if you° forgive men their trespasses, your° heavenly
Father will also be forgiving you°. 6:15 But if you° do° not forgive men their trespasses, neither will
your° Father be forgiving your° trespasses.

          Now whenever you° fast, do° not become just-like the hypocrites, with a gloomy face; for* they
disfigure their faces, *that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly I am saying to you°, They
are fully having their reward. 6:17 But when you are fasting, anoint your head and wash your face 6:18
*
  that you should not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret, and your Father
who sees in secret will be repaying you.
     6:19
          Do° not store up treasures upon the earth for you°, where moth and rust ingest, and where
thieves burrow through your° wall and steal. 6:20 But store° up treasures for you° in heaven, where
neither moth nor rust ingest, and where thieves do not burrow through nor steal. 6:21 For* where your°
treasure is, your° heart will also be there.
     6:22
          The lamp of the body is the eye, therefore, if your eye is clear, your whole body will be radiant.
6:23
      But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore, if the light which is in you is
darkness, how-much greater is the darkness!
     6:24
          No one is able to serve* two lords, for* either he will hate the one and will love* the other; or
he will hold to one and will despise the other. You° are not able to serve* God and money {Money as
in God of Money,’ a.k.a. ‘The Almighty Dollar.’}
     6:25
          Because of this, I am saying to you°, Do° not be anxious for your° life, what you° may eat and
what you° may drink; nor for what you° may clothe your° body with. Is not the life worth more-than
the nourishment and the body worth more-than the clothing? 6:26 Look° at the birds of the heaven, that
they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your° heavenly Father is nourishing them. Are
you° not rather carrying more-value-than them? 6:27 Now who out-of you° is able to add one cubit
upon his stature by being anxious? 6:28 And why are you° anxious concerning clothing? Learn° from
the lilies of the field, somehow they are growing; they are not laboring, nor are they spinning. 6:29 But
I am saying to you°, that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these. 6:30 But if
God so dresses-up the grass of the field, which is here today and the next-day is cast into the oven,
will he not much more clothe you°? Small faith ones!
     6:31
          Therefore, do° not be anxious, saying, What should we eat? or, What should we drink? or,
What should we dress ourselves in? 6:32 For* the Gentiles are seeking after all these things; for* your°
heavenly Father knows that you° have needs of all these things. 6:33 But first seek° the kingdom of
God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you°. 6:34 Therefore, do° not be
anxious *for the next-day; for* the next-day will be anxious enough for the things of itself. Its evil
is enough for the day.

you looking at the speck, the one in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the beam in your own

who is knocking, it will be opened. 7:9 Or what man is there out-of you°, who, if his son asks him for
a loaf he will not give him a stone, will he? 7:10 And if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a
serpent, will he? 7:11 Therefore, if you°, being evil, know to give good presents to your° children, how-

         Enter° in through the narrow gate, because wide is the gate and broad is the way, the one
leading to destruction and many people are the ones who are entering through it. 7:14 Why is it?
Narrow is the gate and pressed is the way, the one leading to life and few are the ones who are
finding it.
    7:15
         But take-heed°, stay away from false* prophets, who are coming to you° in sheep’s clothing,
but inside are ravening wolves. 7:16 You° will fully know them from their fruits. They do not collect
a grape-cluster from thorns or figs from thistles, do they? 7:17 Thus every good tree produces good
fruits, but the rotten tree produces evil fruits. 7:18 A good tree is not able to produce evil fruits, nor
is a rotten tree able to produce good fruits. 7:19 Every tree which is not producing good fruit is cut off
and cast into the fire. 7:20 Consequently*, you° will fully know them from their fruits. 7:21 Not everyone
who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one practicing the
will of my Father, the one in the heavens. 7:22 Many will be saying to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did
we not: prophesy in your name, and cast forth demons in your name, and practiced many miracles
in your name? 7:23 And then I will confess to them, I never knew you°. Depart° from me, the one
working the lawlessness.

a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock; 7:25 and the rain descended and the rivers came up
and the winds blew and fell before that house, and it did not fall; for* it had been founded upon the
rock. 7:26 And everyone hearing these words from me and who is not doing* them, will be similar
to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand; 7:27 and the rain descended and the rivers came
up and the winds blew and hit that house and it fell and great was its fall.

roof, but only speak by word and my young-servant will be healed. 8:9 For* I am a man also under
authority, having soldiers under myself and I say to this one, Travel on and he is traveling on, and
to another, Come and he comes, and to my bondservant, Do* this and he does* it.
     8:10
          Now after Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to the ones who are following, Assuredly I am
saying to you°, Not even in Israel, have I found so-great a faith. {Or: belief; and throughout the N.T.} 8:11
But I am saying to you°, that many will be coming from the east and the west, and will be reclined
with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens; 8:12 but the sons of the kingdom
will be cast forth into the outer darkness; the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there. 8:13 And
Jesus said to the centurion, Proceed on, and as you have believed, let it happen for you. And his
young-servant was healed in that hour.

     Now after it became evening, they brought to him many demon-possessed and he cast forth the

behold, all the herd of swine rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the waters. 8:33 Now the
ones feeding them fled and went away into the city and reported all things and even the things of the

one speaking, but the Spirit of your° Father who speaks in you°. 10:21 Now brother will be giving up
brother to death and the father the child he has and children will be standing up against parents and
will be slaying them. 10:22 And you° will be hated by all people because of my name. But he who has
endured to the end, this one will be saved. 10:23 But whenever they may persecute you° in this city,
flee° into another; for* assuredly I am saying to you°, You° should never complete the cities of Israel,
until the Son of Man should come.
    10:24
          A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a bondservant above his lord. 10:25 It is enough for the
disciple that* he should become like his teacher and the bondservant like his lord. If they called the
householder Beelzebub, how-much more the kinfolk! 10:26 Therefore, do° not fear them; for* nothing
is being hidden, which will not be revealed, and nothing secret, which will not be known. 10:27 What
I am speaking to you° in the darkness, speak° in the light, and what you° hear in your° ear, preach°
upon the housetops. 10:28 And do° not have fear from the ones who kill the body, but are not able to
kill the soul, but rather fear° the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 10:29 Are two
sparrows not sold for a copper-coin? And not one out-of them will be falling upon the earth without
your° Father knowing it; 10:30 but even the hairs of your° head are all being numbered. 10:31 Therefore,
do° not fear, because you° are carrying more-value-than many sparrows. 10:32 Therefore, everyone who
will confess to be in me before men, I will also confess to be in him before my Father, who is in the
heavens. 10:33 But whoever denies me before men, I will also be denying him before my Father who
is in the heavens.
    10:34
          Do° not suppose that I came to cast peace upon the earth; I came, not to cast peace, but a
sword. 10:35 For* I came to pit man against his father and the daughter against her mother and the
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 10:36 and, ‘A man’s enemies will be his own kinfolk.’ {Mic
7:6} 10:37 He who loves his father or mother above me is not worthy of me, and he who loves his son
or daughter above me is not worthy of me. 10:38 And he who is not taking up his cross and following
after me, is not worthy of me. 10:39 He who has found his life will be losing it, and he who has lost
his life because of me will be finding it.
    10:40
          He who accepts you°, accepts me; and he who accepts me, accepts the one who sent me. 10:41
He who accepts a prophet in the name of a prophet, will be receiving a reward of a prophet, and he
who accepts a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, will be receiving a righteous man’s
reward. 10:42 And whoever delivers only a cup of cold water to drink to one of these little ones, in the
name of a disciple, assuredly I am saying to you°, He should never lose his reward.

         And it happened when Jesus had completed commanding his twelve disciples, he went-away
from there to teach and to preach in their cities.
    {Mat 11:2-30 & Luk 7:18-35 Galilee.}
    11:2
         Now after John heard the works of the Christ while in prison, he sent two of his disciples 11:3
and said to him, Are you the one who is coming, or should we expect a different one?
    11:4
         And Jesus answered and said to them, After traveling back, report° to John what you° hear and

see: 11:5 the blind recover their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear,
the dead are raised and the poor are proclaimed the good-news. 11:6 And whoever is not offended at
me is fortunate.
    11:7
          Now while these disciples are traveling on, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John,
What did you° go forth into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 11:8 But what did you°
go forth to see? A man who has been dressed-up in soft garments? Behold, the ones wearing soft
garments are in royal houses. 11:9 But why did you° go forth? To see a prophet? I am saying to you°,
Yes, and one who is more-than a prophet. 11:10 For* this is he, concerning whom it has been written,
‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will be preparing your way before you.’ {Mal
3:1} 11:11 Assuredly I am saying to you°, A greater man has not been raised up among those born of
women than John the Immerser*. But he who is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than
he. 11:12 But from the days of John the Immerser* until now the kingdom of the heavens suffers-
violently and the violent ones seize it. 11:13 For* all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
11:14
      And if you° are willing to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who is the one about to come. 11:15 He
who has ears to hear, let him hear.
      11:16
             But to what will be similar to this generation? It is similar to children sitting in the
marketplaces and shouting to their comrades 11:17 and saying, We piped to you° and you° did not
dance. We mourned for you° and yet you° did not grieve for yourselves. 11:18 For* John came neither
eating nor drinking and they say, He has a demon. 11:19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking and
they say, Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! And
wisdom was made righteous from her children.
     11:20
            Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had happened, because
they did not repent. 11:21 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles
which happened in Tyre and Sidon the ones having happened in you°, they would have repented
long-ago in sackcloth and ashes. 11:22 However I say to you°, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and
Sidon in the day of judgment than for you°. 11:23 And you, Capernaum, who was exalted to heaven,
you will be descending insofar as Hades, because if the miracles which happened in Sodom, the ones
having happened in you, they would have remained till today. 11:24 However I say to you°, that it will
be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.
     11:25
            Jesus answered and said at that time, I profess you, O Father, Lord of heaven and the earth,
that you hid these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants. 11:26 Yes, Father,
because thus it became a delight before you. 11:27 All things were given to me by my Father and no
one fully knows the Son, except the Father; nor does anyone know the Father fully, except the Son
and he to whomever the Son wills to reveal him. 11:28 Come-here° to me, all the ones laboring and
have been loaded down, and I will be giving-rest to you°. 11:29 Take° my yoke upon you° and learn°
from me, because I am meek and humble in heart and you° will be finding rest for your° souls. 11:30
For* my yoke is easy and my load is light.

    12:1
          Jesus traveled on the Sabbath through the grain-fields at that time, and his disciples were
hungry and began to pluck the tops and to eat them. 12:2 But the Pharisees, having seen it, said to him,
Behold, your disciples are doing* what is not legal to practice on the Sabbath.
    12:3
          But he said to them, Did you° not read what David did*, when he himself hungered and the
ones with him; 12:4 how he entered into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was not legal
for him to eat, nor the ones with him, unlawful except for the priests only? 12:5 Or have you° not read
in the law, that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and yet are crimeless?
{1Sam 21:6} 12:6 But I am saying to you°, that a greater thing than the temple is here. 12:7 But if you° had
known what is meant by this, ‘I will to have mercy and not sacrifice,’ {Hos 6:6} You° would not have
sentenced the crimeless. 12:8 For* the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.
    {Mar 3:1-6 & Mat 12:9-14 & Luk 6:6-11 Probably Galilee.}
    12:9
          And having gone-away from there, he went into their synagogue. 12:10 And behold, there was
a man who has a dried up hand. And they asked him, in-order-that they might accuse him, saying,
Is it legal if one was to heal on the Sabbath?
    12:11
          But he said to them, What man will there be out-of you°, who will have one sheep and if this
one falls into a ditch on the Sabbath, will he not take-hold of it and lift it up? 12:12 Therefore, how-
much does a man carry more-value-than a sheep? So-then is it legal to do* good on the Sabbath?
    12:13
          Then he says to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and it was restored
as healthy as the other. 12:14 But the Pharisees having gone forth, took a council against him, *that
they should destroy him.
    {Mar 3:7-12 & Mat 12:15-21 Sea of Galilee.}
    12:15
          But Jesus having known it, departed from there and large crowds followed him, and he healed
them all, 12:16 and rebuked them, in-order-that they should not make* him apparent; 12:17 *that what
was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, 12:18 ‘Behold, my young-servant
whom I selected. My beloved in whom my soul was delighted. I will be placing my Spirit upon him
and he will be proclaiming judgment to the Gentiles.’ 12:19 ‘He will not have selfish ambition, nor will
he cry-out; nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. 12:20 He will not fracture a bruised reed and
he will not quench a smoking wick, until he should cast forth the judgment to victory. 12:21 And the
Gentiles will hope in his name.’ {Isa 42:1-3}
    {Mar 3:19b-30 & Mat 12:22-37.}
    12:22
          Then a blind and mute man being demon-possessed was brought to him, and he healed him,
so-then the blind and mute man is able both to speak and to see. 12:23 And all the crowds were
astonished and were saying, This is not the son of David, is it?
    12:24
           But after the Pharisees heard it, they said, This one is not casting forth demons, except in
Beelzebub the ruler of the demons.
    12:25
          But Jesus knowing their contemplations said to them, Every kingdom having been divided
against itself is made desolate, and every city or house having been divided against itself will not be
established. 12:26 And if the Adversary casts forth the Adversary, he was divided against himself.
Therefore, how will his kingdom be established? 12:27 And if I cast forth demons in Beelzebub, in
whom do your° sons cast them forth? They themselves will be your° judges because of this. 12:28 But


38                                                                                            mlvbible.com
if I cast forth demons with* the Spirit of God; consequently*, the kingdom of God has arrived-
unexpectedly upon you°. 12:29 Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong man, and
to be ravening through his goods, if he does not first bind the strong man? And then he will be
ravening through his house. 12:30 He who is not with me is against me and he who is not gathering
together with me scatters. 12:31 Because of this, I am saying to you°, Every sin and blasphemy will
be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven to men. 12:32 And whoever
speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the Holy
Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, not in the age which is now, nor in the future one. 12:33 Either
make*° the tree good and its fruit good; or make*° the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for* the tree is
known from the fruit it has. 12:34 Offsprings of vipers! How are you°, being evil, able to speak good
things? For* out-of the abundance of the heart the mouth is speaking. 12:35 The good man out-of the
good treasure in him, is casting forth good things and the evil man out-of the evil treasure in him, is
casting forth evil things. 12:36 But I am saying to you°, that every idle declaration, whatever men speak,
they will be giving an account in the day of judgment concerning it. 12:37 For* you will be made
righteous from your words and you will be sentenced from your words.
    {Mat 12:38-45; no parallel.}
    12:38
          Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign
from you.
    12:39
          But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation is seeking after a sign,
and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet; 12:40 for* just-like Jonah was
three days and three nights in the belly of the sea-creature; so will the Son of Man be three days and
three nights in the heart of the earth.
    12:41
          The men of the Ninevites will be standing up with this generation in the judgment and will
be condemning it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, more-than Jonah is
here. 12:42 The queen of the south will be arisen with this generation in the judgment and will be
condemning it, because she came from the limits of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and
behold, more-than Solomon is here.
    12:43
          But the unclean spirit, whenever it goes away from the man, it goes through waterless places,
seeking rest and does not find it. 12:44 Then it says, I will return into my house from where I came
forth, and having gone back, it finds it unoccupied, that it has been swept and has been adorned. 12:45
Then it travels and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself and when it has entered
again, they dwell there and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will also be
to this evil generation.
    {Mar 3:31-35 & Mat 12:46-50 & Luk 8:19-21.}
    12:46
          But while he is still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brethren stood outside,
seeking to speak to him. 12:47 Now someone said to him, Behold, your mother and your brethren are
standing outside, seeking to speak to you.
    12:48
          But he answered and said to the one who spoke to him, Who is my mother? And who are my
brethren? 12:49 And he stretched out his hand over toward the disciples and said, Behold, my mother
and my brethren! 12:50 For* whoever practices the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he himself
is my brother and sister and mother.

     13:1
          Now in that day, Jesus went away from the house and was sitting beside the sea. 13:2 And large
crowds were gathered to see him, so-then he stepped onto a ship to sit, and all the crowd stood upon
the beach.
     13:3
          And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
13:4
      and while* he himself was sowing, some which fell beside the road and the birds came and
devoured them.
     13:5
          Now others fell upon the rocky-areas, where it did not have much soil and immediately it rose
up because it had no depth of soil; 13:6 and after the sun rose, it was burnt, and it dried up because it
has no root.
     13:7
          Now others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns shot-up and choked them.
     13:8
          But now, others fell upon the good soil and was giving fruit, which some was a hundred times,
but which some was sixty, but which some was thirty.
     13:9
          He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
     13:10
           And the disciples came near and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables?
     13:11
            But he answered and said to them, It has been given to you° to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of the heavens, but it has not been given to those men. 13:12 For* whoever has, to him will
be given and he will abound, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken-away from
him. 13:13 Because of this, I speak to them in parables, because seeing, they do not see, and hearing,
they do not hear, nor do they understand. 13:14 And the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them, which
says, ‘In hearing you° will hear and should never understand, and seeing you° will see and should
never know; 13:15 for* the heart of this people became-callous and they have selectively heard with
their ears and they closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes and should hear with their
ears and should understand with their heart and should turn again and I will be healing them.’ {Isa
6:9-10} 13:16 But your° eyes are fortunate, because they are seeing, and your° ears, because they are
hearing. 13:17 For* assuredly I am saying to you°, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see
the things which you° are seeing and did not see them, and to hear the things you° are hearing and did
not hear them.
     13:18
           Therefore, you°, hear° the parable of the sower: 13:19 everyone hearing the word of the kingdom
and not understanding it, then the evil one comes and seizes what has been sown in his heart. This
is he who was sown beside the road.
     13:20
           And he who was sown upon the rocky-areas, this is he who hears the word and immediately
is receiving it with joy; 13:21 but he does not have root in himself, but is temporary, and after affliction
or persecution has happened to him because of the word, immediately he stumbles.
     13:22
           And he who was sown into the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of this
age and the deception of riches, choke the word and he becomes unfruitful.
     13:23
           Now he who was sown upon the good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it;
who bears-fruit and produces some a hundred times, and some sixty, and some thirty!
        {Mat 13:24-30; no parallel.}

a man who sows good seed in his field; 13:25 but while* the men were sleeping, his enemy came and
sowed darnels between the stalks of the wheat and went away. 13:26 But when the blade sprouted and
produced fruit, then the darnels also appeared. 13:27 Now the bondservants of the householder came
near and said to him, Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? Therefore, from where have the
darnels come?
    13:28
           Now he said to them, A man, an enemy, did* this.
    Now the bondservants said to him, Therefore, do you wish that after we have gone away, that we
will collect them?
    13:29
           But he said, No; lest while collecting up the darnels, you° may uproot the wheat at the same-
time with them. 13:30 Allow° both to be grown together till the harvest, and I will be saying to the
reapers in the time of the harvest, Collect° first the darnels and bind° them in bundles in-order-to burn
them, but gather° together the wheat into my barn.
    {Mar 4:30-34 & Mat 13:31-35.}
    13:31
           He placed another parable before them, saying: The kingdom of the heavens is similar to a
kernel of a mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; 13:32 which indeed is least
compared to all of the other seeds, but whenever it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes
a tree, so-then the birds of the heaven come and nest in its branches.
    13:33
           He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is similar to leaven, which
a woman took and hid in three three-gallon-containers of flour, until which time it was entirely
leavened.
     13:34
            Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds, and he was not speaking to them
without a parable; 13:35 *that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, ‘I will
open my mouth in parables. I will be uttering things which have been hidden from the conception
of the world.’ {Psa 78:2}
    {Mat 13:36-53; no parallel.}
    13:36
           Then Jesus, having left the crowds, went into the house and his disciples came to him, saying,
Explain to us the parable of the darnels of the field.
    13:37
           Now he answered and said to them, He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man; 13:38
and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, and the darnels are
the sons of the evil one; 13:39 and the enemy who sowed them is the devil and the harvest is the end
of the world, and the reapers are messengers. 13:40 Therefore, just-like the darnels are collected and
burned in fire; so it will be in the end of this world. 13:41 The Son of Man will be sending forth his
messengers and they will be collecting out-of his kingdom all the offenses and the ones practicing
lawlessness, 13:42 and will be casting them into the furnace of fire; the weeping and the gnashing of
teeth will be there. 13:43 Then the righteous will be shining out like the sun in the kingdom of their
Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
    13:44
          Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a treasure which has been hidden in the field;
which a man having found, he hid, and he proceeds-away and sells all his things from his joy, as
many things as he has and buys that field.


mlvbible.org                                                                                          41
    13:45
          Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a man, who is a merchant, seeking beautiful
pearls; 13:46 who found one very precious pearl, went and has sold* all his things, as many things as
he had, and bought it.
    13:47
          Again, the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a dragnet, which was cast into the sea and
gathered fish from every variety; 13:48 which, when it was filled, they hauled it up upon the beach. And
having sat down, they collected the good into containers, but they cast the rotten outside. 13:49 So it
will be in the end of the world; the messengers will be going forth and separate* the evil from the
midst of the righteous, 13:50 and will be casting them into the furnace of fire; the weeping and the
gnashing of teeth will be there.
    13:51
          Jesus says to them, Have you° understood all these things?
    They say to him, Yes, Lord.
    13:52
          Now he said to them, Because of this, every scribe who was made a disciple to the kingdom
of the heavens is similar to a man who is a householder, who casts forth out-of his treasure, new and
old things.
    13:53
          And it happened, when Jesus had completed these parables, he took off from there.
    {Mar 6:1-6a & Mat 13:54-58 Nazareth.}
    13:54
          And after he came into his fatherland, he was teaching them in their synagogue, so-then for
them to be astounded and to say, From where did this one receive the wisdom and the miracles? 13:55
Is this not the son of the carpenter? Is his mother not called* Mary? And his brethren, James and
Joses and Simon and Jude? 13:56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Therefore, from where did
this one receive all these things? 13:57 And they were being offended at him.
    But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his fatherland and in his own
house. 13:58 And he did not do* many miracles there because of their unbelief.

         Herod the Tetrarch heard the report of Jesus at that time, 14:2 and said to his young-servants,
This is John the Immerser*; he was raised from the dead, and because of this, these powers are
working in him. 14:3 For* Herod having taken-hold of John, bound him and placed him in prison
because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.

prophet.

          Now Herod’s birthday-festivities being brought* together, the daughter of Herodias danced
in the midst of the court and pleased Herod; 14:7 from where he confessed with an oath to give her
whatever she herself might ask for.

          Now having been pushed forward by her mother, she says, Give me the head of John the
Immerser* upon a platter here.

were reclining at the meal together-with him, he commanded it to be given. 14:10 And he sent and
beheaded John in the prison. 14:11 And his head was carried upon a platter, and given to the girl, and
she carried it to her mother. 14:12 And his disciples came near and lifted up the body, and buried it,

          And after Jesus went forth, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion upon them and
healed their sick. 14:15 Now after it became evening, his disciples came near to him, saying, The place
is desolate and the hour has already passed-away; dismiss the crowds in-order-that after they have
gone away into the villages, they might buy various foods for themselves.
    14:16
          But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go away; you°, give° them food to eat!
    14:17
          But they say to him, We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish.
    14:18
          Now he said, Bring° them here to me. 14:19 And he commanded the crowds to recline upon the
grass, and he took the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to heaven, he gave-thanks and
broke them. He gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples then gave to the crowds. 14:20 And
they all ate and were fully-fed, and they took up what is leftover of the broken pieces, twelve baskets
full. 14:21 Now the ones eating were approximately five thousand men, plus women and children.
    {Mar 6:45-56 & Mat 14:22-36 & Joh 6:15-21.}

          And immediately, Jesus urged the disciples to step onto the ship, and to precede him to the
area beyond-that, until which time he should dismiss the crowds. 14:23 And having dismissed the
crowds, he went-up into the mountain privately to pray. Now after it became evening, he was alone
there. 14:24 But the ship was already in the midst of the sea, and was being tormented by the waves;
for* the wind was adverse. 14:25 Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking
upon the sea. 14:26 And after the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were disturbed, saying,
It is an apparition, and they cried out from their fear.
    14:27
          But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Have° courage; I am here; do° not be afraid.

upon the waters.

          Now he said, Come.
    And Peter descended from the ship, and walked upon the waters to go toward Jesus. 14:30 But he
was afraid, seeing the strong wind, and began to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!

          Now Jesus immediately stretched out his hand, and grabbed him, and says to him, Small faith
ones! In what were you skeptical?
    14:32
          And after they themselves stepped into the ship, the wind paused. 14:33 Now the ones who are
in the ship came to him and, worshiped him, saying, You are truly the Son of God.
    14:34
          And having ferried over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. 14:35 And after the men of that
place recognized him, they sent word into the whole region around that place and brought to him all

disciples transgressing the tradition of the elders? For* they do not wash their hands whenever they
eat bread.
   15:3
         But he answered and said to them, Why do you° also transgress the commandment of God

{Exo 20:12 & Deu 5:16} And, ‘He who is speaking evil of their father or mother, let him be ended by
the sentence of death.’ {Exo 21:17 & Lev 20:9} 15:5 But you° say, Whoever says to the father or the
mother, in whatever you might be profited from me, it is a gift to God, and then should never honor
his father or mother, 15:6 and thus you° invalidated the commandment of God because of your°
tradition. 15:7 O hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well concerning you°, saying, 15:8 ‘This people are
drawing near to me with their mouth, and are honoring me with their lips, but their heart is distant,
faraway from me. 15:9 But they are worshiping me in futility, teaching as their teachings the
commandments of men.’ {Isa 29:13}
   15:10
          And having called the crowd, he said to them, Hear° and understand°! 15:11 Not what enters into
the mouth desecrates the man, but what is traveling from the mouth, this desecrates the man.
   15:12
          Then the disciples came near to him and said, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended
after they heard the speech of yours?
    15:13
           But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly father did not plant will be
uprooted. 15:14 Leave° them! They are blind guides of the blind. Now if the blind guide the blind, both

perceiving, that everything which travels into the mouth is making room in the belly, and is cast forth
into the sewer? 15:18 But the things traveling out from the mouth, come forth from the heart, and they
desecrate the man. 15:19 For* out-of the heart comes forth evil reasonings, murders, adulteries,
fornications, thefts, false* testimonies, blasphemies. 15:20 These things are what is desecrating the
man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not desecrate the man.

and blood did not reveal it to you, but my Father, the one in the heavens. 16:18 But I also say to you,
that you are Peter {Pebble} and upon this, the rock {i.e., rock foundation}, I will be building my

have already been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose upon the earth will have already

one that he himself is Jesus, the Christ.

    18:15
          Now if your brother should sin at {i.e., against} you, proceed-away and reprove him, the sin is
between you and him only; if he hears you, you have gained your brother. 18:16 But if he does not hear
you, take with you one or two more, in-order-that, ‘at the mouth of two or three witnesses every
declaration should be established.’ {Deu 19:15} 18:17 But if he should refuse to hear them, tell it to the
congregation*, and if he also should refuse to hear the congregation*, let him be just-like the Gentile
and the tax collector to you.
    18:18
          Assuredly, I am saying to you°, As many things as you° would bind upon the earth will have
already been bound in heaven, and as many things as you° would loose upon earth will have already
been loosed in heaven. 18:19 Assuredly I say to you° again, that if two of you° agree together upon the
earth concerning any matter, whatever they ask, it will happen for them from my Father who is in
the heavens. 18:20 For* where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there in the midst
of them.
    18:21
          Then Peter came near to him and said, Lord, how-often will my brother sin against {Greek: at
or toward} me and I will forgive him? Until seven-times?
    18:22
          Jesus says to him, I do not say to you, Until seven-times, but, until seventy-times seven. 18:23
Because of this, the kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man: a king who wished to settle the
account with his bondservants. 18:24 Now having begun to settle the account, one man was brought
to him, a debtor of ten-thousand silver talants {170 million dollars US}. 18:25 But he had nothing to repay
him with, so his lord commanded him and his wife and children and all things, as many things as he
was holding, to be sold* and the money to be repaid to him.
    18:26
           Therefore, the bondservant having fallen down, was worshiping him, saying, Lord, have
patience upon me, and I will be repaying all of it to you. 18:27 But the lord of that bondservant, having
compassion on him, released him and forgave him the loan.
    18:28
          But that bondservant went forth and found one of his fellow bondservants who was owing
him a hundred denarii, and he took-hold of him, and was choking him, saying, Repay if you are
owing me anything.
    18:29
          Therefore, his fellow bondservant, having fallen at his feet, was pleading with him, saying,
Have patience upon me and I will be repaying you. 18:30 But he did not wish to, but having gone away
he cast him into prison, until he should repay what is owed. 18:31 But his fellow bondservants, having
seen the things which happened, were extremely sorrowful. And they came to their own lord, and
they told all the things which had happened.
    18:32
          Then having called him, his lord says to him, Evil bondservant, I forgave you all that debt,
since you pleaded with me. 18:33 Was it not essential for you to show-mercy also on your fellow
bondservant, like I also showed-mercy to you. 18:34 And his lord was made angry, and gave him to
the torturers until he should repay everything which is owed to him. 18:35 So my heavenly Father will
also be doing* to you°, if each of you° does not forgive his brother their trespasses from your° hearts.

          And the Pharisees came to him, testing him and saying to him, If it is legal for a man to
divorce his wife according-to every cause?
   19:4
         But he answered and said to them, Did you° not read, He who made* them, made* them male
and female from the beginning. {Gen 1:27, 5:2} 19:5 And said, Because of this, a man will be leaving
the father and the mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will be jointed into one flesh.
{Gen 2:24} 19:6 So-then they are no more two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God yoked together; let
man not separate.
   19:7
         They say to him, Therefore, why did Moses command us to give a document of divorcement
and to release her? {Deu 24:1-4}
   19:8
         He says to them, Moses permitted* you° to divorce your° wives for your° hardness of heart, but
from the beginning it has not become so. 19:9 But I am saying to you°, Whoever divorces his wife not
over {Greek: upon. Or: upon the basis of} fornication, and should marry another, is committing adultery,
and he who married the one who has been divorced is committing adultery. {Mat 5:32, Luk 16:18}

          His disciples say to him, If thus is the case of the man with his wife, it is not advantageous
to marry.
   19:11
          But he said to them, Not all people will make room for this word in their hearts, but they to
whom it has been given: 19:12 for* there are eunuchs who were born so out-of the womb of their
mother, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made
themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who is able to make room in his
heart {i.e., accept this} for it, let him make room for it.

might pray for them, and the disciples rebuked them. 19:14 But Jesus said, Allow° the young children,
and do° not forbid them to come to me; for* the kingdom of the heavens is of such. 19:15 And having
laid his hands upon them, he traveled from there.

should I practice in-order-that I may have everlasting life?
   19:17
          Now he said to him, Why do you call* me good? No one is good except one: God, but if you
wish to enter into everlasting life, keep the commandments.
   19:18
          He says to him, What ones?
   Now Jesus said, 'Do not murder; Do not commit adultery; Do not steal; Do not falsely testify, 19:19
Honor your father and mother.' {Exo 20:12-16 & Deu 5:16-20} And, 'You will love* your neighbor like

          The young-man says to him, I have observed all these things from my youth. What am I still
lacking?

          Jesus said to him, If you are willing to be complete, proceed-away, sell your possessions and
give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come-here. Follow me. 19:22 But after the
young-man heard the word, he went away, being sorrowful; for* he was holding many properties.
   19:23

through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
     19:25
           Now after his disciples heard it, they were being extremely astounded, saying, Who then is
able to be saved?
     19:26
            But Jesus, looked at them and said to them, This is impossible with men, but all things are
possible with God.
     19:27
           Then Peter answered and said to him, Behold, we left all and followed you; what then will
be left for us?
     19:28
            But Jesus said to them, Assuredly I am saying to you°, that you° who have followed me,
whenever the Son of Man sits upon the throne of his glory in the regeneration*, you° will also sit
upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 19:29 And everyone who has left houses or
brethren or sisters, or their father or mother or wife, or children or fields, because of my name, will
be receiving a hundred-times that, and will be inheriting everlasting life. 19:30 But many will be last

     20:1
          For* the kingdom of the heavens is similar to a man who is a householder, who went forth at
the same-time every morning to hire workers into his vineyard. 20:2 And having agreed together with
the workers at a denarius a day {a standard day’s pay}, he sent them into his vineyard. 20:3 And he went
forth around the third hour {i.e., 9:00 AM} and saw others standing idle in the marketplace; 20:4 and he
said to those men, You° also, proceed° into the vineyard and I will be giving you° whatever is just.
20:5
     Again, they went forth around the sixth {i.e., Noon} and the ninth hour; {i.e., 3:00 PM} and he did*
likewise*. 20:6 Now around the eleventh hour, {i.e., 5:00 PM} he went forth and found others standing
idle, and he says to them, Why are you° standing here idle the whole day?
     20:7
           They say to him, Because no one hired us.
     So he says to them, You° also, proceed° into the vineyard and you° will be receiving whatever is
just. 20:8 Now after it became evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his commissioner, Call the
workers and after you have begun from the last until the first, give to them their wages. 20:9 And after
the hired ones around the eleventh hour {i.e., 5:00 PM} came, they each received a denarius apiece.
20:10
       Now after the first came, they supposed that they will be receiving more, but they themselves
also received a denarius apiece.
     20:11
           But having received it, they were murmuring against the householder, 20:12 saying, These last
ones did* only one hour of work, and you made* them equal to us, who bore the burden of the day
and the burning heat.
     20:13
           But he answered and said to one of them, Comrade, I am not wronging you. Did you not agree
together-with me for a denarius? 20:14 Take up the thing which is yours and proceed-away. I will to
give to this last one, as I also did to you. 20:15 Or is it not legal for me to do* what I will in the things
which are mine? Or what if your eye is evil, because I am good? {i.e., They are envious.} 20:16 So the last
will be first, and the first last; for* many are the invited ones but few are chosen.

asking something from him. 20:21 But he said to her, What do you wish?
    She says to him, Say that* these, my two sons, may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left
hand in your kingdom.

          But Jesus answered and said, You° do not know what you° ask. Are you° able to drink the cup
which I am about to drink, or to be immersed* with the immersion* to which I am about to be
immersed*?
    They say to him, We are able.
    20:23
          And he says to them, Indeed, you° will be drinking my cup and you° will be immersed* with
the immersion* to which I am immersed*, but to sit at my right and at my left, is not mine to give,
but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father. 20:24 And having heard this, the ten were
indignant concerning the two brothers.

garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road.

heir. Come-here°. We should kill him, and we might hold-onto his inheritance. 21:39 And having taken
him, they cast him forth outside the vineyard, and killed him. 21:40 Therefore, whenever the lord of

as you° would find, invite° to the marriage-festivities. 22:10 And those bondservants, having gone forth
into the roads, gathered together everyone, as many people as they found, both evil and good and the
marriage was filled with people reclining at the table.
     22:11
           But after the king entered to look at the ones reclining at the table, he saw a man there who
has not clothed himself with marriage attire; 22:12 and he says to him, Comrade, how did you enter
here not having on your marriage attire? Now he was dumbfounded. 22:13 Then the king said to the
servants, After you° have bound him hands and feet, take° him away and cast° him forth into the outer
darkness; the weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there. 22:14 For* many are the invited ones,
but few are chosen.

            Then the Pharisees traveling away, took a council on how they might ensnare him in his
speech. 22:16 And they send their disciples to him, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that
you are true* and teach the way of God in truth, and do not care concerning one’s appearance; for*
you do not look at the countenance of men. 22:17 Therefore, tell us, What do you think? Is it legal to
give tribute to Caesar or not?
     22:18
           But Jesus, having known their wickedness, said, Why are you° testing me, you° hypocrites?
22:19
      Show° me the tribute coin. Now they brought to him a denarius. 22:20 And he says to them, Whose
face is this image and inscription? 22:21 They say to him, Caesar’s. Then he says to them, Therefore,
give° to Caesar, the things which are Caesar’s, and to God, the things which are God’s. 22:22 And
having heard it, they marveled. And they went away, having left him.

           The Sadducees came to him in that day, the ones saying, There is to be no resurrection, and
they asked him, 22:24 saying, Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies, having no children, his brother will
marry his wife and will be raising* up seed to his brother. {Deu 25:5} 22:25 Now seven brothers were
with us, and the first having married, but after he died*, having no seed, left his wife to his brother;
22:26
      likewise also the second and the third, until the seventh. 22:27 But after them all, the woman also
died. 22:28 Therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven in the resurrection? For* they all had her as
a wife.
    22:29
           But Jesus answered and said to them, You° are being misled, by not knowing the Scriptures,
nor the power of God. 22:30 For* they neither marry, nor are betrothed in the resurrection, but are like
messengers of God in heaven. 22:31 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you° not read
what was said to you° by God, saying, 22:32 I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the
God of Jacob? {Exo 3:6} God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. 22:33 And after the crowds
heard it, they were being astounded over his teaching.
     {Mar 12:28-34 & Mat 22:34-40 & Luk 20:40.}
     22:34
           But the Pharisees, having heard that he had hushed the Sadducees, were gathered together
upon the same ground. 22:35 And one out-of them, a professor of the law, asked a question, testing
him and saying, 22:36 Teacher, what is the great commandment in the law?

           Now Jesus said to him, You will love* the Lord your God in your whole heart and in your
whole soul and in your whole mind. {Deu 6:5} 22:38 This is the first and the great commandment. 22:39
And the second commandment is similar to it, You will love* your neighbor like yourself. {Lev 19:18}

       The whole law and the prophets are hung together in these two commandments.

           Now the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, 22:42 saying,
What do you° think concerning the Christ? Whose son is he?
     They say to him, David’s.
     22:43
           He says to them, Therefore, how does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying, 22:44 The Lord
said to my Lord, Sit at my right, until I should place your enemies as the footstool of your feet? {Psa
110:1} 22:45 Therefore, if David calls him Lord, how is he his son? 22:46 And no one was able to
answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day forth to ask him anymore questions.

keep, keep° and do*°, but do*° not do them according-to their works; for* they say and are not doing*.

who are holding a child in their womb {i.e., pregnant} and to the ones who are nursing in those days!

will be great affliction, such-as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor
should never happen again. 24:22 And except those days were shortened, not any flesh would have
been saved, but because of the chosen, those days will be shortened. 24:23 Then if anyone says to you°,
Behold, here is the Christ; or, over here is the Christ. Do° not believe it. 24:24 For* false* Christs and
false* prophets will be raised and will be giving great signs and wonders; so-then to mislead, if
possible, even the chosen. 24:25 Behold, I have said to you° beforehand. 24:26 Therefore, if they say to
you°, Behold, he is in the wilderness; do° not go. Behold, he is in the storerooms; do° not believe it.

back, and settles the account with them. 25:20 And he who received the five talants came near and
brought the other five talants, saying, Lord, You gave to me five talants. Behold, I gained another
five talants over them.

are a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter; 25:25
and I was afraid and went away and hid your talant in the soil. Behold, you have yours.
   25:26
          But his lord answered and said to him, Evil and lazy bondservant, you knew that I reap where
I did not sow and gather from where I did not scatter? 25:27 Therefore, it was essential for you to put
my silver with the bankers, and when I came back, I would get back mine for myself together-with
interest. 25:28 Therefore, take° the talant from him and give° it to the one who has the ten talants. 25:29

to drink; 25:43 I was a stranger and you° did not bring* me in; naked and you° did not dress me; sick
and in prison and you° did not visit me.
    25:44
          Then they themselves will also answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty,
or as a stranger or naked, or sick or in prison, and did not serve you?
    25:45
          Then he will answer them, saying, Assuredly I am saying to you°, Inasmuch as you° did * it not
to one of these, the least, neither did* you° do it to me. 25:46 And these will be going away into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.

    {Mar 14:1-2 & Mat 26:1-5 & Luk 22:1-2 mountain Olives, Bethany, Jerusalem, Tues Evening, Wed. for the Jews.}
    26:1
         And it happened, when Jesus had completed all these words, he said to his disciples, 26:2 You°
know that after two days the Passover happens and the Son of Man is given up, *that* he might be
crucified.
    26:3
          Then the high-priests and the scribes and the elders of the people were gathered together to
the courtyard of the high-priest, the one being called* Caiaphas; 26:4 and they planned together in-
order-that they might take-hold of Jesus with treachery, and might kill him. 26:5 But they were saying,
Not at the feast, in-order-that an uproar among the people might not happen.
    {Mar 14:3-9 & Mat 26:6-13.}
    26:6
          Now after Jesus came* into Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 26:7 a woman came to
him, having an alabaster flask of precious perfume, and she poured it upon his head when he was
reclining at the table. 26:8 But after his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, To what purpose
is this waste? 26:9 For* this perfume was able to be sold* for much and given to the poor.
    26:10
           But Jesus having known, said to them, Why are you° harassing the woman? For* she has
worked a good work *for me. 26:11 For* you° always have the poor with yourselves, but you° do not
always have me. 26:12 For* when this woman put this perfume upon my body, she did* it in-order-to
bury me. 26:13 Assuredly I am saying to you°, Wherever this good-news might be preached in the
whole world, what this woman did*, will also be spoken of *for her memorial.
    {Mar 14:10-11 & Mat 26:14-16 & Luk 22:3-6 & Joh 12:2-8.}
    26:14
          Then one of the twelve, who is called* Judas Iscariot, traveling on to the high-priests 26:15 and
said, What are you° willing to give me and I will be giving him up to you°? Now they weighed out
thirty pieces of silver for him. 26:16 And he was seeking an opportunity from then onward in-order-
that he might give him to them.
    {Mar 14:12-17 & Mat 26:17-20 & Luk 22:7-18, 22:24-30 Bethany to Jerusalem Thur. Evening.}
    26:17
          Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where
do you wish that we will prepare the Passover for you to eat?
    26:18
          Now he said, Proceed° into the city to a certain-person, and say° to him, The Teacher says, My
time is near. I am making* the Passover with you at your house with my disciples. 26:19 And the
disciples did* as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.
    {Mar 14:18-21, 14:27-31 & Mat 26:21-25, 26:31-35 & Luk 22:21-23, 22:31-38 & Joh 13:21-38.}

    26:20
           Now after it became evening, he was reclining at the table with the twelve.
    26:21
           And while they themselves are eating, he said, Assuredly I am saying to you°, that one out-of
      °
you will be giving me up.
    26:22
           And they were extremely sorrowful, and each of them began to say to him, I am not the one,
am I, Lord?
     26:23
            But he answered and said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, this one will be
giving me up to the Jews. 26:24 The Son of Man indeed is proceeding-away, just-as it has been written
concerning him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is given up! It was {i.e., would
be} good for him if that man was not ever born. {Psa 22:1-31?}
    26:25
           Now Judas (the one giving him up to the Jews), answered and said, I am not the one, am I
rabbi?
    He says to him, You have said so.
    {Mar 14:22-25 & Mat 26:26-29 & Luk 22:19-20, 1Co 11:23-26.}
    26:26
           Now while they themselves are eating, Jesus, took the bread. Having given-thanks, he broke
it, and was giving it to the disciples and said, Take°, eat°; this is my body. 26:27 And having taken the
cup and given-thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink° from it, all of you°; 26:28 for* this is my blood
of the new covenant*, which is poured out concerning many into the forgiveness of sins. 26:29 But I
am saying to you°, I should never drink from this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day
whenever I drink it new with you° in my Father’s kingdom.
    {Mar 14:26, 14:32-42 & Mat 26:30, 26:36-46 & Luk 22:39-46 & Joh 18:1 Garden between Stream of Kidron and
Mountain of Olives, Late Thur. night.}
    26:30
           And having sung a hymn, they went forth to the Mountain of Olives.
    {See Mat 26:31-35 above.}
    26:31
           Then Jesus says to them, All of you° will be offended at me this night; for* it has been written,
I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. {Zec 13:7} 26:32 But after the time
for me to be raised, I will be preceding you° into Galilee.
     26:33
            But Peter answered and said to him, If all will be offended at you; but I will never be
offended.
    26:34
           Jesus said to him, Assuredly I am saying to you that in this night, before the rooster is to crow,
you will be denying me three-times.
    26:35
           Peter says to him, Even if it is essential for me to die together-with you, I should never deny
you. And all the disciples said likewise.
    {See Mat 26:30 above.}
     26:36
            Then Jesus comes to a parcel of ground with them, called* Gethsemane, and says to the
disciples, Sit° over there, until which time I have gone and might pray there*. 26:37 And he took Peter
and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and to be disheartened. 26:38 Then Jesus says
to them, My soul is very sorrowful until death. Remain° here and watch° with me.
    26:39
           And having gone a little further, he fell upon his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it is
possible, let this cup pass-away from me; however, not as I will, but as you will.
    26:40
           And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping and says to Peter, So, were you° not


62                                                                                                  mlvbible.com
strong-enough to watch with me one hour? 26:41 Watch° and pray° in-order-that you° may not enter
into temptation. The spirit is indeed eager, but the flesh is weak.
   26:42
          Having gone away again a second-time, he prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup is not able
to pass from me, if I do not drink it, let your will happen.
   26:43
          And he came again and finds them sleeping, for* their eyes were heavy. 26:44 And having left
them again, he went away and prayed a third-time, and said again the same speech.
   26:45
          Then he comes to his disciples and says to them, Are you° furthermore sleeping the time away
and resting yourselves? Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is given up into the
hands of sinners. 26:46 Arise°, we should be proceeding. Behold, the one giving me up to the Jews has
drawn near.
   {Mar 14:43-52 & Mat 26:47-56 & Luk 22:47-53 & Joh 18:2-11 Gethsemane, Fri. a few hours before dawn.}
   26:47
          And while still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came and with him, a large crowd
with swords and clubs, from the high-priests and elders of the people. 26:48 Now the one giving him
up, gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss; it is him; take-hold° of him. 26:49 And immediately
he came near to Jesus and said, Hail, rabbi. And he kissed him.
   26:50
          But Jesus said to him, Comrade, upon what purpose are you here? Then they came near and
put hands upon Jesus and took-hold of him. 26:51 And behold, one of the ones who was with Jesus
stretched out his hand and pulled the sword, and struck the bondservant of the high-priest, and took
off his ear.
   26:52
          Then Jesus says to him, Return your sword into its place; for* all the ones who have taken up
the sword will be dying with* the sword. 26:53 Or do you think that I am not able now to plead with
my Father and he will not stand beside me with more than twelve legions of messengers? 26:54
Therefore, how might the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it is essential to happen as thus?
   26:55
          Jesus said to the crowds in that hour, Why did you° come forth with swords and clubs to take
me, like against a robber? I was sitting daily with you° in the temple, teaching, and you° have not
taken-hold of me. 26:56 But this whole thing has happened in-order-that the Scriptures of the prophets
might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.
   {Mar 14:53 & Mat 26:57 & Luk 22:54a & Joh 18:24 Palace of Caiaphas, before dawn.}
   26:57
          Now the ones who took-hold of Jesus led him away to the house of Caiaphas the high-priest,
where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
   {Mar 14:54 & Mat 26:58 & Luk 22:54b-62 & Joh 18:15-18 Courtyard of High Priest’s residence, Fri. around dawn.}
    26:58
          But Peter was following him from afar until the courtyard of the high-priest, and entered
inside, and was sitting with the attendants, to see the end.
   {Mar 14:55-65 & Mat 26:59-68 & Luk 22:63-65.}
    26:59
          Now the high-priests and the elders and the whole council were seeking false* testimony
against Jesus, how they might slay him; 26:60 and they did not find any, even though many false*
witnesses came. Still, they did not find any. 26:61 But later, two false* witnesses came near and said,
This one was saying, I am able to tear-down the temple of God and to build it again through {i.e., in}
three days.
   26:62
          And the high-priest, having stood up, said to him, Are you answering nothing? What are these
witnesses testifying against you? 26:63 But Jesus was silent. And the high-priest answered and said


mlvbible.org                                                                                              63
to him, I implore you before the living God in-order-that you should tell us if you are the Christ, the
Son of God?
    26:64
          Jesus says to him, You have said so. However I am saying to you°, From now on, you° will
see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.
   26:65
          Then the high-priest ripped his garments, saying, He blasphemed. Why do we still have need
of witnesses? Behold, now you° have heard his blasphemy. 26:66 What are you° thinking?
   And they answered and said, He is liable of death. 26:67 Then they spat at his face and battered him,
and some slapped him, 26:68 saying, Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is he who struck you?
    {Mar 14:66-72 & Mat 26:69-75 & Luk 22:55-62 & Joh 18:25-27.}
    26:69
          Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one maidservant came to him, saying,
You were also with Jesus the Galilean.
    26:70
          But he denied it before them all, saying, I do not know what you are saying.
   26:71
          Now having gone forth into the gate area, another one saw him, and says to them there, This
one was also with Jesus of the Nazarenes.
    26:72
          And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
   26:73
          Now after a little while, the ones standing by, came near and said to Peter, You truly also are
one out-of them; for* even your speech makes* it evident.
    26:74
          Then he began to curse and to swear, I do not know the man. And immediately, the rooster
crowed. 26:75 And Peter was reminded of the declaration of Jesus, when he had said to him, Before
the rooster is to crow, you will be denying me three-times. And having gone outside, he wept
bitterly.

    {Mar 15:1 & Mat 27:1-2 Luk 22:66-23:1 Joh 18:28a Jerusalem early Fri. morning.}
    27:1
         Now after it became morning, all the high-priests and the elders of the people took a council
against Jesus so-as to slay him; 27:2 and having bound him, they led him away and gave him up to
Pontius Pilate the governor.
    {Mat 27:3-10 & Acts 1:18-19 Fri. morning and toward the future.}
    27:3
          Then Judas (the one giving him up), after he saw that he was condemned, regretted and
returned the thirty pieces of silver to the high-priests and the elders, 27:4 saying, I sinned, having given
up innocent blood.
    But they said, What is that to us? You will see. 27:5 And having tossed the pieces of silver in the
temple, he departed. And having gone away, he hung-himself.
    27:6
          Now the high-priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not legal to put them into the
depository, since it is the price of blood. 27:7 Now they took a council and bought from them the
potter’s field, *for the burial of strangers. 27:8 Hence until today, that field was called, The Field of
Blood. 27:9 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, ‘And they took
the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one who had been priced, whom some of the sons from
Israel priced for themselves; 27:10 and they gave them *for the potter’s field, just-as the Lord
commanded me.’ {Jer 32:6-9}

    27:11
           Now Jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him, saying, Are you the King
of the Jews?
     Now Jesus said to him, You speak it correctly. 27:12 And while* he himself was accused by the
high-priests and the elders, he answered nothing.
     27:13
           Then Pilate says to him, Do you not hear how-many things they are testifying against you?
27:14
      And he did not answer him, not even with one word; so-then making the governor to marvel
exceedingly.
     {Mar 15:6-19 & Mat 27:15-30 & Joh 18:39-19:16 Fri., April 7, 30AD.}
     27:15
           Now the governor had been accustomed every Passover feast to release one prisoner to the
crowd, whom they were wishing for. 27:16 Now then they were holding a notable prisoner called*
Barabbas. 27:17 Therefore, having been gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you° wish
that I may release to you°? Barabbas or Jesus who is called* Christ? 27:18 For* he knew that they gave
him up because of envy.
    27:19
           Now while sitting upon the judicial-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing between
you and that righteous man; for* I suffered many things today in a dream because of him.
     27:20
           Now the high-priests and the elders persuaded the crowds in-order-that they should ask for
Barabbas and should destroy Jesus. 27:21 But the governor answered and said to them, Whom do you°
wish that I may release to you° from the two?
     But they said, Barabbas!
     27:22
           Pilate says to them, Therefore, what should I do* to Jesus who is called* Christ?
     They all say to him, Let him be crucified!
     27:23
           But the governor said, For* what evil did he do*?
     But they were crying out even-more, saying, Let him be crucified!
     27:24
           Pilate saw he is profiting nothing, but rather that an uproar is happening, took water and
washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, I am innocent from the blood of this righteous man;
you° will see to it.
     27:25
           And all the people answered and said, His blood is upon us and upon our children.
    27:26
           Then he released to them Barabbas, but having scourged Jesus, he gave him up in-order-that
he should be crucified.
    27:27
           Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the palace and gathered together the whole
cohort {600 soldiers} upon him. 27:28 And having stripped him, they placed a scarlet cloak around him.
27:29
      And having braided a crown from thorns, they placed it upon his head and a reed upon his right
hand, and they knelt down before him and were mocking him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 27:30
And having spat at him, they took the reed and were beating it into his head.
     {Mar 15:20-23 & Mat 27:31-34 & Luk 23:26-33 & Joh 19:17 Road to the Cross, Fri. morning.}
     27:31
           And when they had mocked him, they stripped the cloak off him and clothed him with his
own garments and led him away, *that* they should crucify him.
    27:32
           Now while going forth, they found a man from Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this
one to go with them in-order-that he might lift up his cross.


mlvbible.org                                                                                           65
    27:33
          And they came to a place called* Golgotha, which is called*, the place of a skull; 27:34 they
gave him vinegar to drink, having been mixed with gall. And having tasted it, he was not willing to
drink it.
    {Mar 15:24-32 & Mat 27:35-44 & Luk 23:33-43 & Joh 19:18-27 9:00 until Noon, Fri.}
    27:35
          Now having crucified him, ‘they divided his garments, casting a lot’; {T} in-order-that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, ‘They divided my garments among them and they cast a lot
for my garment.’ {Psa 22.18} 27:36 And sitting down, they were guarding him there. 27:37 And they
placed above his head an accusation which had been written, This Jesus is the King of the Jews. 27:38
Then two robbers are crucified together-with him, one at the right and one at the left. 27:39 Now the
ones who are traveling by were blaspheming him, wagging their heads, 27:40 and saying, He who
tears-down the temple and builds it in three days, save yourself. If you are the Son of God, come-
down from the cross.
    27:41
          Now likewise, also the high-priests with the scribes and elders and Pharisees, mocking him,
and were saying, 27:42 He saved others, yet he is not able to save himself. If he is the King of Israel;
let him come-down now from the cross and we will believe in him. 27:43 He has confidence upon God.
Let him rescue him now, if he is willing to save him; for* he said, I am the Son of God. 27:44 Now the
robbers who were also crucified together-with him were reproaching him with the same thing.
    {Mar 15:34 & Mat 27:45 & Luk 23:44 around Noon.}
    27:45
          Now darkness became upon all the earth from the sixth hour until the ninth hour {i.e., Noon
until 3:00 PM; Amos 8:8-9?}.
    {Mar 15:34-41 & Mat 27:46-56 & Luk 23:45-49 & Joh 19:28-30 around 5:00 PM.}
    27:46
          Now around the ninth hour {i.e., 3:00 PM} Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama
sabachthani? This is: ‘My God, my God, why did you forsake me?’ {Psa 22:1}
    27:47
          But some of the ones standing there, after they heard it, were saying, This one is summoning
Elijah. 27:48 And immediately one out-of them ran, took a sponge and filled it from the vinegar vessel
and placed it around a reed and was delivering a drink to him.
    27:49
          But the rest were saying, Allow it, that we may see if Elijah comes; he will save him.
    27:50
          Now Jesus, having cried again with a loud voice, his spirit left. 27:51 And behold, the curtain
of the temple was split-apart into two pieces, from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken,
and the rocks were split-apart; 27:52 and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the holy-ones
who had fallen-asleep were raised.
    27:53
          And having gone forth out-of the tombs after his awakening, they entered into the holy city
and were manifesting themselves to many.
   27:54
          Now the centurion and the ones guarding Jesus with him, having seen the earthquake and the
things which happened, were extremely afraid, saying, This one truly was the Son of God. 27:55 Now
many women were there viewing from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him: 27:56
among whom was Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of
the sons of Zebedee.
    {Mar 15:42-47 & Mat 27:57-66 & Luk 23:50-56 & Joh 19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}

made himself a disciple to Jesus. 27:58 This one having gone to Pilate, asked for the body of Jesus.
Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up. 27:59 And Joseph took the body and entwined it in
a clean linen cloth, 27:60 and placed it in his new tomb, which he had hewed out in the rock and he
rolled a great stone in the doorway of the tomb and went away. 27:61 Now Mary the Magdalene and
the other Mary were there, sitting in front of the burial chamber.
    27:62
          Now on the next-day, which is the day after the Preparation, the high-priests and the Pharisees
were gathered together to Pilate, 27:63 saying, Lord, we have remembered what that misleader said
while still living, I am raised after three days. 27:64 Therefore, command that the burial chamber is to
be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, might steal him away and
might say to the people, He was raised from the dead and the last deceit will be worse than the first.
    27:65
          Now Pilate said to them, You° have a sentry. Proceed° away, make° it as secure as you° know

how.          Now traveling away, they secured the burial chamber, having sealed the stone, and with
the sentry.

                                           {{ Introduction to Mark 45-52 AD.
    The book of Mark, better titled as ‘The Good-news According to Mark,’ was written for a Roman audience. The
author of the book does not identify himself, but the early Christian congregations attributed the authorship to John Mark,
cousin of Barnabas and possibly Peter’s son. It is fast paced and should have been the first book of the New Testament.
With this in mind, many feel this gospel was written primarily to the Romans who were very industrious and proud of
their achievements. Jesus’ heroic service to others and His willingness to die for others would attract Roman attention
too. The Romans were not interested in lots of extra details, nor were they too concerned about prophecies contained
in Jewish writings from hundreds of years earlier (Mark only quotes three Old Testament prophecies). Mark even
disregards many instances of special Jewish interest and explains Jewish customs and language for non-Jewish readers
(5:41; 7:34; 15:34). Mark gives us one of the three reasons for Jesus’ death: A ransom for many - 10:45. For the
forgiveness of sins - Matthew 26:28. For the sheep - John 10:11. Isaiah 52:13-53:12 is the very relevant background for
this Good-news book. The events in Mark are held by scholars to be in chronological order. Starting from His immersion
(baptism) Mark portrays Jesus as a Man constantly on the move for God, with the word ‘immediately’ appearing 42 times
in this book, the shortest of the Good-news accounts. Percentage-wise, Mark spends more time dealing with the final
week of Jesus’ life than any of the other Good-news writers. The final instructions given by Jesus after His resurrection,
in this biography, are to ‘preach the good-news to the whole creation. He who believes and is immersed will be saved,
but he who disbelieves will be condemned’ (Mark 16:15-16).}}

Simon’s sons, casting a net in the sea; for* they were fishermen. 1:17 And Jesus said to them, Come-
here° after me and I will make* you° to become fishermen of men. 1:18 And immediately they left their
nets and followed him. 1:19 And having advanced a few feet from there, he saw James and John his

know you, I know who you are, the Holy One of God.

         And the unclean spirit went forth out-of him, having convulsed him and having cried out with
a loud voice. 1:27 And they were all amazed, so-then they began to debate together-with themselves,
saying, What is this thing? What new teaching is this that he commands even the unclean spirits
according-to God’s authority, and they are obeying* him?

Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 1:30 Now Simon’s mother-in-law was reclining, fevered,

taken-hold of her hand, and immediately the fever left her and she was serving them.

         Now after it became evening, when the sun set, they were bringing to him all who have an
illness and the ones being demon-possessed. 1:33 And the whole city was being gathered together next

demons, and he was not allowing the demons to speak, because they knew him.

went away into a desolate place, and he was praying there. 1:36 And Simon, and the ones with him,
pursued him; 1:37 and having found him, they say to him, All are seeking you.

         And he says to them, We should be proceeding into the next towns in-order-that I should also

If you are willing, you are able to cleanse me.

         Now Jesus, having compassion on him, stretched out his hand, touched him and says to him,
I am willing. Be cleansed. 1:42 And having said that, the leprosy immediately went away from him
and he was cleansed. 1:43 And having scolded him, he immediately put him forth, 1:44 and says to him,
See that you say nothing to anyone, but proceed-away; show yourself to the priest, and offer the thing
which Moses commanded concerning your cleansing *for a testimony to them. {Lev 13:49, 14:2-4} 1:45
But he went forth and began to preach it much, and to broadcast the word, so-then he {i.e., Jesus} was
no longer able to openly enter into the city, but was outside in desolate places, and they were coming
to him from everywhere.

         And they come, carrying to him a paralytic, lifted up by four men. 2:4 And not being able to
draw near to him because of the crowd, they unroofed the roof where he was. And they shoveled a
hole in it, and lower the pallet upon which the paralytic was laying. 2:5 Now Jesus saw their faith {Or:
belief; and throughout the N.T.} and says to the paralytic, Child, your sins have been forgiven to you.

to them, Why are you° reasoning these things in your° hearts? 2:9 What is easier to say to the
paralytic, Your sins have been forgiven; or to say, Lift yourself up, and take up your pallet and walk?

     But in-order-that you° may know that the Son of Man has authority upon the earth to forgive sins

fast?

           And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridal-party {companions or guests} are not able to fast
at which time the bridegroom is with them, are they? Inasmuch time as they have the bridegroom
with themselves, they are not able to fast. 2:20 But the days will come, whenever the bridegroom is
taken away from them and then they will be fasting in those days. 2:21 And no one sews a patch of
unshrunk fabric upon an old garment; otherwise its fullness shrinks and lifts the new patch up from
the old one and a worse split happens. 2:22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise

be able to eat bread. 3:21 And after the ones close beside him heard it, they went forth to take-hold
of him; for* they were saying that he was crazy.
     3:22
           And the scribes that came-down from Jerusalem were saying, He has Beelzebub, and, He is
casting forth the demons by the ruler of the demons.
     3:23
           And having called them, he was speaking to them in parables: How is the Adversary able to
cast forth the Adversary? 3:24 And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to
stand. 3:25 And if a house is divided against itself, that house is not able to stand. 3:26 And if the
Adversary has stood up against himself, and has been divided, he is not able to stand, but has come
to an end. 3:27 No one having entered into the house of the strong man is able to be ravening through
his goods, if he does not first bind the strong man, and then he may be ravening through his house.

     Assuredly I am saying to you°, All their sins and blasphemies will be forgiven to the sons of men;
as many things as they would blaspheme. 3:29 But whoever might blaspheme at the Holy Spirit does
not have forgiveness, forever, but is liable to an everlasting judgment. 3:30 (Because they were saying,
‘He has an unclean spirit.’)

summoning him. 3:32 And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, Behold, your mother
and your brothers and your sisters are outside seeking you.
     3:33
           And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren? 3:34 And having looked
around in a circle at those sitting around him, he says, Behold, my mother and my brethren! 3:35 For*
whoever practices the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.

          And again he began to teach beside the sea. And a large crowd was gathered together to him,
so-then having stepped onto the ship to sit in the sea, and all the crowd were next to the sea upon the
land.
     4:2
         And he was teaching them many things in parables and said to them in his teaching, 4:3 Listen°:
behold, the sower went forth to sow, 4:4 and it happened, while* he was sowing, some seed which fell
beside the road and the birds came and devoured it. 4:5 But other seed fell upon the rocky-area, where
it did not have much earth, and immediately it rose up, because it had no depth of earth; 4:6 now after
the sun rose, it was burnt, and it dried up because of it has no root. 4:7 And other seed fell into the
thorns, and the thorns shot-up and choked it, and it gave no fruit. 4:8 And other seed fell into the good
soil and it was giving fruit, shooting-up and growing, and it was bringing forth by thirty times, and
by sixty times, and by a hundred times as much. 4:9 And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him
hear.
     4:10
          And when he happened to be alone, the ones around him together-with the twelve, asked about
the parable. 4:11 And he said to them, It has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God,
but to those, the ones who are outside, all things happen in parables; 4:12 in-order-that seeing, they
may see and yet may not know, and hearing, they may hear and yet may not understand; lest they

should turn again and their sins might be forgiven them.
      4:13
           And he says to them, Do you° not know this parable? And how will you° know all the
parables? 4:14 The sower is sowing the word. 4:15 Now these are the ones beside the road, where the
word is sown, and whenever they hear, immediately the Adversary comes and takes the word which
has been sown in their hearts.
     4:16
          And likewise, these are the ones who are sown upon the rocky-areas, who, whenever they hear
the word, they immediately receive it with joy; 4:17 and they have no root in themselves, but are
temporary. Thereafter, after affliction or persecution happened to them because of the word,
immediately they stumble.
     4:18
           And these are the ones who are sown into the thorns; the ones who hear the word, 4:19 and the
anxieties of this age, and the deception of riches, and the lusts concerning all the rest of the worldly
things travel into their hearts, are choking the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
     4:20
           And these are the ones who were sown upon the good soil; who hear the word and accept it,
and bear-fruit, by thirty times and by sixty times and by a hundred times.
     4:21
           And he said to them, Why not come with the lamp in-order-that it might be placed under a
peck-container or under the bed? No, you bring it in-order-that it might be placed upon the lamp-
stand. 4:22 For* not anything is hidden, which would not be made manifest, nor has anything hidden,
happened, but in-order-that it should come into apparent view. 4:23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him
hear.
     4:24
           And he said to them, Beware° what you° are hearing; in what measure, you° measure, it will
be measured to you°, and to you° who hear, more will be added. 4:25 For* whoever has, to him will be
given, and he who does not have, and what he has will be taken from him.
     {Mar 4:26-29; no parallel.}
     4:26
           And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man cast seed upon the earth; 4:27 and he should
sleep and should arise night and day, and the seed may sprout and should be lengthened, he himself
did not know how. 4:28 For* the earth is bearing-fruit by herself; first the blade, thereafter the top,
thereafter the full grain in the top. 4:29 But whenever the fruit gives way, immediately he sends forth
the sickle, because the harvest is standing ready.

     {Mar 4:30-34 & Mat 13:31-35.}
     4:30
           And he said, To what may be similar to the kingdom of God? Or in what parable may we put
it in comparison? 4:31 It is like a kernel of a mustard-seed, which, whenever it should be sown upon
the earth, though it is least compared to all the seeds which are upon the earth, 4:32 and yet whenever
it should be sown, it shoots-up and becomes greater than all the herbs and produces great branches;
so-as for the birds of the heaven to be able to nest under its shadow.
     4:33
           And he was speaking the word to them with many such parables, as they were able to hear it.
4:34
     But he was not speaking to them without a parable, but privately he was interpreting all things
for his disciples.

         And after it became evening in that day, he says to them, We should go through to the area
beyond-that. 4:36 And having left the crowd, they take him with them, as he was in the ship. But also
other small-boats were with him. 4:37 And a great gale of wind happens, and the waves were putting
water into the ship, so-as for it now to be filled with water. 4:38 And he himself was upon the stern,
sleeping upon the cushion, and they awaken him and say to him, Teacher, do you not care that we
are perishing?
    4:39
         And having been awakened, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Be silent. Hush. And
the wind paused and it became a great calm. 4:40 And he said to them, Why are you° so cowardly?
How do you° not have faith?
    4:41
         And they feared with a great fear, and were saying to one another, Who then is this, that even
the wind and the sea are obeying* him?

    5:1
        And they came to the area of the sea beyond-that, into the region of the Gadarenes. 5:2 And he
went forth out-of the ship by himself, immediately a man encountered him out-of the tombs in him
was an unclean spirit, 5:3 who had his dwelling in the tombs, and no one was able to bind him, not
even in chains. 5:4 Because of the same, he had been bound often in shackles and chains, and the
chains had been torn to shreds by him and the shackles had been crushed, and no one was strong-
enough to tame him. 5:5 And he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones, night and day,
in the mountains and in the tombs.
    5:6
         Now after he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped him. 5:7 And having cried out with a
loud voice, he said, What is this thing with me and with you, Jesus, Son of the Highest God? I am
imploring you by God, do° not torment me.
    5:8
        For* he said to him, Come forth out-of the man, you unclean spirit. 5:9 And he was asking him,
What name is in you?
     And he answered, saying, Legion is the name in me, because we are many. 5:10 And he was
pleading with him much in-order-that he might not send them forth outside the region. 5:11 Now there
was there a great herd of swine being fed before the mountain. 5:12 And all the demons pleaded with
him, saying, Send us into the swine, in-order-that we may enter into them. 5:13 And Jesus immediately
permitted* them. And the unclean spirits came forth, and entered into the swine and the herd rushed
down the cliff into the sea. Now they were approximately two thousand, and they were choked in
the sea.
    5:14
         Now the ones feeding the swine fled and reported it to the city and to the rural-areas. And they
came forth to see what it is which has happened. 5:15 And they come to Jesus and are viewing the one
previously being demon-possessed and has had the legion, sitting and having his garments on and
being sensible, and they were afraid. 5:16 But the ones who saw it described to them how it happened
to the one previously being demon-possessed and concerning the swine. 5:17 And they began to plead
with him to go away from their borders.
    5:18
         And after he stepped onto the ship, he who was demon-possessed was pleading with him in-

order-that he may be with him. 5:19 But Jesus did not allow him, but says to him, Proceed-away to
your house, to who are yours and report to them how-much the Lord has done* for you and how he
showed-mercy on you. 5:20 And he went and began to preach in Decapolis how-much Jesus did* for
him and all were marveling.
    5:21
         And after Jesus ferried over again in the ship to the area beyond-that, a large crowd was
gathered upon him, and he was beside the sea.
   {Mar 5:22-43 & Mat 9:18-26 & Luk 8:41-56 Capernaum.}
   5:22
         And behold one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, comes and having seen him,
he falls toward his feet; 5:23 and was pleading with him much, saying, My young-daughter is holding
on her last moments. I pray that* you might lay your hands upon her after you have gone to her, *that
she may be cured and will live. 5:24 And he went with him.
    And a large crowd was following him and they were pressing against him. 5:25 And a certain
woman, being in her a flowing of blood for twelve years, 5:26 and had suffered many things under
many physicians and had spent from her things all and was profited nothing, but rather she came into
a worse condition. 5:27 Having heard concerning Jesus, she came in the crowd behind and touched
his garment. 5:28 For* she was saying, If-only I touch his garments, I will be cured. 5:29 And
immediately the spring of her blood was dried up, and she knew that she has been healed from the
disorder in her body. 5:30 And immediately Jesus, having fully known in himself that the power went
forth from him and having turned around in the crowd, said, Who touched my garments?
   5:31
         And his disciples were saying to him, You see the crowd pressing against you and you say,
Who touched me? 5:32 And he was looking around to see the one having done* this thing. 5:33 But the
woman was afraid, trembling, and knowing what has happened upon her, came and fell down before
him and spoke all the truth to him.
   5:34
         And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has cured you; proceed-away in peace and be healthy
from your disorder.
   5:35
         While he is still speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Your
daughter died. Why are you still bothering the Teacher?
   5:36
        But Jesus immediately having heard the word being spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue,
Do not fear, only believe. 5:37 And he allowed no one to follow together-with him, except Peter and
James and John the brother of James. 5:38 And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue,
and he views an uproar, many weeping and wailing. 5:39 And having entered, he says to them, Why
are you° in an uproar and weeping? The child has not died, but is sleeping. 5:40 And they were
laughing at him. But having cast them all forth, he takes the father of the child and the mother and
the ones with him and he travels into where the child was reclining. 5:41 And having taken-hold of
hand of the child, he says to her, Talitha kumi; which is, after being translated, Girl, I say to you, Lift
yourself up! 5:42 And immediately the girl rose* up and was walking; for* she was twelve years old.
And they were astonished with a great astonishment. 5:43 And he ordered them much in-order-that
no one should know this and he said that something is to be given to her to eat.

being astounded, saying, From where did this one receive these things? And what is the wisdom

carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Jude and Simon? And are not his
sisters here with us? And they were being offended at him.

you°, nor may not hear you°, while traveling out from there, shake-off° the dirt which is underneath
your° feet *for a testimony to them. Assuredly, I am saying to you°, It will be more tolerable for
Sodom or Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city. 6:12 And they, the twelve, went forth

not legal for you to have your brother’s wife.’ 6:19 But Herodias was holding it against him. And she

the meal together-with him. The king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you wish and I will be giving
it to you. 6:23 And after he had sworn to her, Whatever you might ask me, I will be giving it to you,
insofar as half of my kingdom.

executioner and commanded his head to be brought. 6:28 Now he went and beheaded him in the
prison, and carried his head upon a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.

how-much they had done* and how-much they had taught. 6:31 And he said to them, You° yourselves

ones proceeding-away were many and they were not having an opportunity to eat. 6:32 And they went
away into a desolate place in the ship privately.

on-foot from all of the cities and went before them, and came together to him. 6:34 And Jesus went
forth, and saw a large crowd and he had compassion upon them, because they were like sheep not
having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things.

place is desolate and already it is a late hour; 6:36 dismiss them, in-order-that they might buy bread
for themselves, after they have gone into the circle of the rural-areas and villages, for* they do not
have what they might eat {i.e., they have nothing to eat}.

loaves, and we might give them that to eat?

groups; all the groups upon the pale-green grass. 6:40 And they leaned-back in rows of a hundred
apiece and rows of fifty apiece. 6:41 And he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looked up to
heaven, he gave-thanks and broke the loaves. And he was giving them to his disciples in-order-that
they might place the bread beside them, and he divided the two fish to all. 6:42 And they all ate and
were fully-fed. 6:43 And they took up twelve full baskets of broken pieces and also from the fish. 6:44

to pass-beside them.

afraid. 6:51 And he went-up to them into the ship, and the wind paused, and they were exceedingly,
exceptionally, astonished in themselves and were marveling! 6:52 For* they did not understand what
happened upon the loaves, for* their heart was hardening. 6:53 And having ferried over, they came
upon the land of Gennesaret and they were anchored there, 6:54 and they themselves gone forth out-of

          Having ran around that whole region around there, they began to carry around the ones having
an illness upon their pallets, where they were hearing: he is over there. 6:56 And wherever he was
traveling, if into villages or cities or the rural-areas, they were laying the sick in the marketplaces and
were pleading with him in-order-that if-only they might touch the hem of his garment, and as many
as would touch him were being cured.

hands scrubbing with the fist, do not eat, holding-fast the tradition of the elders; 7:4 and when coming
from the marketplace, they do not eat if they have not immersed* {bathe} themselves first, and there
are many other things which they took to holding-fast, like immersions* {Or, O.T. ceremonial washings}
of cups and pint pitchers and brass kettles and cots. 7:5 Thereafter, the Pharisees and the scribes ask
him, Why are your disciples not walking according-to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread
with unwashed hands?
     7:6
         But he answered and said to them, Isaiah prophesied well concerning you° hypocrites, as it has
been written, ‘This people are honoring me with their lips, but their heart is distant, faraway from
me. 7:7 But they are worshiping me in futility, teaching as their teachings the commandments of men.’
{Isa 29:13} 7:8 For* after you° left the commandment of God, you° are holding-fast the tradition of men,
like immersions* of pint pitchers and cups, and you° practice many other such similar things.
     7:9
          And he said to them, You° are rejecting well the commandment of God, in-order-that you°
might keep your° tradition. 7:10 For* Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother.’ {Exo 20:12 &
Deu 5:16} And, ‘He who is speaking evil of father or mother, let him be ended by the sentence of
death.’ {Exo 21:17 & Lev 20:9} 7:11 But you° say, If a man says to his father or his mother, Whatever you
might be profited from me is Corban (what is a gift). 7:12 And so you° no longer allow him to do*
anything for his father or for his mother, 7:13 invalidating the word of God (which you° gave up) by

your° tradition, and you° practice many such similar things.
     7:14
           And having called all the crowd, he said to them, All, hear° me and understand°. 7:15 There is
nothing outside the man, which traveling into him is able to desecrate him, but the things which
travel out from him, those are the things which desecrate the man. 7:16 If anyone has ears to hear, let
him hear.
      7:17
           And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples were asking him
concerning the parable. 7:18 And he says to them, So are you° also without understanding? Are you°
not perceiving, that everything outside which travels into the man, is not able to desecrate him; 7:19
because it is not traveling into the heart, but into the belly and travels into the sewer? (He said thus,
cleansing all foods.) 7:20 Now he said, What travels out from the man, this desecrates the man. 7:21 For*
evil reasonings travel from inside, out-of the heart of men, such as: adulteries, fornications, murders,
7:22
     thefts, greedy-acts, wickednesses, treachery, unbridled-lust, an evil eye, blasphemy, haughtiness,
foolishness. 7:23 All these evil things travel out from inside, and desecrate the man.

           And he stood up and went away from there, into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he
entered into a house and was wishing no one to know it, and he was not able to elude them.

           For* a woman, having heard things concerning him (whose young-daughter herself was
holding an unclean spirit), came and fell down before his feet. 7:26 Now the woman was a Greek, a
Syrophoenician by birth. And she was asking of him in-order-that he might cast forth the demon out-
of her daughter. 7:27 But Jesus said to her, Allow the children first to be fully-fed; for* it is not good
to take the children’s bread and cast it to the puppies.
     7:28
           But she answered, and says to him, Yes, Lord; for* even the puppies underneath the table eat
from the children’s crumbs.
     7:29
           And he said to her, Because of this, the speech, proceed-away; the demon has gone forth out-
of your daughter. 7:30 And she went away to her house and found the daughter of her had been put
upon a cot, the demon having gone forth.

that he might lay his hand upon him. 7:33 And having taken him away from the crowd privately, he
put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue. 7:34 And having looked up to
heaven, he groaned and says to him, Ephphatha; (which is, Be opened). 7:35 And immediately his ears
were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he was speaking correctly. 7:36 And he
ordered them in-order-that they should tell no one, but as many things as he himself was ordering
them not to tell, rather, they were preaching it even-more.

           And they were being abundantly astounded, saying, He has done* all things well; he makes*

          The crowd being enormous in those days, and they do not have what they might eat {i.e., they
have nothing to eat}. Jesus, having called to him his disciples, says to them, 8:2 I have compassion upon
the crowd, because they already remain with me for three days and do not have what they might eat.
8:3
     And if I dismiss them starving to their house, they will faint on the road; for* some of them are
coming from far away.

         And his disciples answered him, From where will anyone be able to fully-feed these men bread
here in the wilderness?
     8:5
          And he was asking them, How-many loaves do you° have?
     Now they said, Seven.
     8:6
         And he commanded the crowd to lean-back upon the soil. And he took the seven loaves, and
having given-thanks, he broke them and was giving them to his disciples in-order-that they might
place them beside them, and they placed them beside the crowd. 8:7 And they were holding a few
small-fish, and having given-thanks, he said to his disciples to also place these beside them. 8:8 Now
they ate and were fully-fed, and they took up abundances of broken pieces, seven baskets. 8:9 Now
the ones who ate were approximately four thousand, and he dismissed them.

Dalmanutha.
     8:11
           And the Pharisees came forth and began to debate together-with him, seeking from him a sign
from the heaven, testing him. 8:12 And having groaned deeply in his spirit, he says, Why is this
generation seeking a sign? Assuredly I am saying to you°, As if a sign will be given to this generation.
8:13
     And having left them, he again stepped onto a ship, and went away to the area beyond-that.
     8:14
           And they forgot to take bread, and they did not have any bread, except one loaf in the ship
with themselves. 8:15 And he was ordering them, saying, Behold° and beware° stay away from the
leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
     8:16
           And they were reasoning with one another, saying, It is because we have no bread.
     8:17
           And Jesus having known it, says to them, Why are you° reasoning so, because you° have no
bread? Do you° not yet perceive, nor understand? Do you° still have your° heart hardened? 8:18 Having
eyes, do you° not see? Having ears, do you° not hear? And do you° not remember? 8:19 When I broke
the five loaves *for the five thousand, how-many baskets full of broken pieces did you° take up?
     They say to him, Twelve.

take up?

          And he comes to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man and they are pleading with him
in-order-that he might touch him. 8:23 And having grabbed the hand of the blind man, he led him
outside the village, and having spat into his eyes, he laid his hands upon him, he was asking him if
he sees anything.
     8:24
          And having looked up, he said, I see men, because I see them like walking trees. 8:25 Thereafter
he laid his hands upon his eyes again, and he made* him to look at him. And he was restored and
looked at everyone distinctly.
     8:26
          And he sent him forth to his house, saying, Neither enter into the village, nor say anything to

          And Jesus went forth and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the road
he was asking his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say me to be {i.e that I am}?
     8:28
          Now they answered, John the Immerser* and others, Elijah, but others, One of the prophets.
     8:29
          And he says to them, But who do you° say me to be {i.e., that I am}?
     Now Peter answered, saying to him, You are the Christ. 8:30 And he rebuked them in-order-that
they should speak to no one concerning him.

          And he began to teach them, that it is essential for the Son of Man to suffer many things and
to be rejected* from the elders and the high-priests and the scribes, and be killed, and to rise* up after
three days. 8:32 And he was speaking the word frankly. And Peter took him and began to rebuke him.
8:33
     But he turned again, and saw his disciples, and rebuked Peter, saying, Proceed-away, behind me,
adversary, because you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.
     8:34
           And having called the crowd together-with his disciples to him, he said to them, Whoever
wishes to follow after me, let him deny himself, and lift up his cross and follow me. 8:35 For* whoever
wishes to save his life will be losing it, and whoever should lose his life because of me and because
of the good-news, this one will be saving it. 8:36 For* what will it profit a man, if he should gain the
whole world and his soul should be forfeited? 8:37 Or what will a man give as an exchange for his
soul? 8:38 For* whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this generation, the adulteress and
sinner, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him, whenever he comes in the glory of his Father
with the holy messengers. [Mark 9] TOC 9:1 And he was saying to them, Assuredly I am saying to
you°, There are some of the ones standing here, who should never taste of death, until they should
see the kingdom of God having come in power.

          And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter and James and John and brings them up alone
into a high mountain privately, and he was transfigured before them; 9:3 and his garments became
gleaming, exceedingly white like snow, such-as no launderer upon the earth is able to whiten. 9:4 And
Elijah, together-with Moses, was seen by them, and they were speaking together-with Jesus.
     9:5
         And Peter answered and says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here, and we should make*
three tabernacles; one to you and one to Moses and one to Elijah. 9:6 For* he did not know what he
will {i.e., should} say; for* they were fearful.

only Jesus with themselves.
      9:9
          Now while coming-down from the mountain, he ordered them in-order-that they should
describe to no one what they saw, except whenever the Son of Man rises* up from the dead. 9:10 And
they took-hold of the word for themselves, debating together-with themselves, What is the thing, to
rise* up from the dead? 9:11 And they were asking him, saying, How is it that the scribes say that it
is essential for Elijah to come first?
     9:12
          But he answered and said to them, Elijah indeed came first, and restores all things, and how
it has been written of the Son of Man in-order-that he should suffer many things and should be
scorned, 9:13 But I am saying to you°, that Elijah has come, and they also did* to him as many things
as they wished, just-as it has been written upon the basis of him.

     9:14
          And after he came back to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes
debating together-with them. 9:15 And immediately all the crowd, having seen him, were utterly
amazed, and running up to him, they were greeting him. 9:16 And he asked the scribes, What are you°
debating together with them?
     9:17
          And one out-of the crowd answered and said, Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a
mute spirit; 9:18 and wherever it overtakes him, it rips at him and he foams and grinds his teeth and
he is dried up, and I spoke to your disciples in-order-that they might cast it out, and yet they were not
strong-enough.
     9:19
          But he answered and says, O unbelieving generation, until when will I be with you°? Until
when will I tolerate you°? Bring° him to me. 9:20 And they brought him to him, and after having seen
him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell upon the earth. He was wallowing, foaming.
9:21
     Now he asked his father, How-much time is it that things like this has happened to him?
     And he said, From childhood. 9:22 And often it has cast him both into fire and into waters in-order-
that it might destroy him, but if you are able to do anything, help us and have compassion upon us.
     9:23
          Now Jesus said to him, If you are able to believe. All things are possible to the one believing.
     9:24
          And immediately the father of the child cried out with tears and said, I believe; Lord, help me
with my unbelief.
     9:25
          Now after Jesus saw that a crowd is running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying
to it, I command you, the mute and deaf spirit, come forth out-of him and enter into him no longer.
     9:26
          And having cried out and having convulsed him much, it came forth, and the boy became like
one dead; so-then for many to say, He died.
     9:27
          But having taken-hold of the hand of him, Jesus lifted him up, and he stood up. 9:28 And having
entered into the house, his disciples were asking him privately, How is it that we were not able to
cast it forth?
     9:29
          And he said to them, This variety is not able to come forth with* anything, except in prayer
and fasting.

          And he came into Capernaum, and after he came* into the house he was asking them, What
were you° reasoning with yourselves on the road? 9:34 But they were silent; for* they had reasoned
with one another on the road, who was greater. 9:35 And having sat down, he summoned the twelve,
and he says to them, If anyone wishes to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all. 9:36 And
having taken a young child, he stood it in the midst of them. And having wrapped it in his arms, he
said to them, 9:37 Whoever accepts one of such children in my name, accepts me, and whoever
accepts me, does not accept me, but the one who sent me.
     9:38
          Now John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw someone casting forth demons in your
name, who is not following us, and we forbade him because he is not following us.
    9:39
          But Jesus said, Do° not forbid him; for* there is no one who will be doing* a miracle in my
name, and be able to speak evil of me quickly. 9:40 For* he who is not against you° is working on your°
behalf. 9:41 For* whoever delivers to you° a cup of water to drink in my name, because you° are of
Christ, assuredly I am saying to you°, He should never lose his reward. 9:42 And whoever offends one
of these little ones who believe in me, it is good for him rather if a mill’s stone encompassed around
his neck, and he has been cast into the sea.
    9:43
          And if your hand offends you, cut it off. It is good for you to enter into life crippled, rather
than having the two hands, and to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire, 9:44 where a maggot of
them does not die* and the fire is not quenched.
    9:45
          And if your foot offends you, cut it off. It is good for you to enter into life lame, rather than
having the two feet, and to be cast into hell, into the unquenchable fire, 9:46 where their maggot does
not die* and the fire is not quenched.
    9:47
          And if your eye offends you, cast it forth. It is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God
one-eyed, rather than having two eyes, and to be cast into the hell of fire, 9:48 where a maggot of
them does not die* and the fire is not quenched.

          For* everyone will be salted with fire and every sacrifice will be salted with salt. 9:50 The salt

Proceed-away, sell as many things as you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in
heaven. And come-here, follow me, having lifted up the cross. 10:22 But he was dismal upon the word,
and went away, being sorrowful; for* he has many properties.
     10:23
           And Jesus, having looked around, says to his disciples, How the ones who have wealth will
hardly enter into the kingdom of God! 10:24 Now the disciples were being amazed upon his words.
But Jesus again answered and says to them, Children, how hard it is for the ones who have
confidence in wealth to enter into the kingdom of God! 10:25 It is easier for a camel to enter through
a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

           Now they were being astounded even-more with themselves, saying to him, And who is able
to be saved?

            Peter began to say to him, Behold, we left all and followed you.

            Jesus answered and said, Assuredly I am saying to you°, There is no one who has left his
house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields, because of me and
because of the good-news, 10:30 who would not receive a hundred-times that now in this time, houses

age everlasting life. 10:31 But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.

           Now they were on the road, going-up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading them and they were
being amazed, and following, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them
the things which are about to befall him, 10:33 saying, Behold, we are going-up to Jerusalem, and the
Son of Man will be given up to the high-priests and scribes, and they will be condemning him to
death and will be giving him up to the Gentiles, 10:34 and they will be mocking him and will be
scourging him and will be spitting on him and will be killing him, and he will rise* up in the third
day.
    10:35
            And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, travel before him, saying, Teacher, we wish that*
whatever we ask, you might do* it for us.
     10:36
            But he said to them, What are you° wishing me to do* for you°?

hand in your glory.

            But Jesus said to them, You° do not know what you° are asking for yourselves. Are you° able
to drink the cup which I am drinking? And to be immersed* in the immersion* which I am immersed*
in?
     10:39
            Now they said to him, We are able.
     But Jesus said to them, Indeed the cup which I am drinking, you° will be drinking, and the
immersion* which I am immersed* in, you° will be immersed* in. 10:40 But to sit at my right and at my
left is not mine to give, but it is for them for whom it has been prepared. 10:41 And having heard it,
the ten began to be indignant concerning James and John.
    10:42
            Now having called them, Jesus says to them, You° know that the ones who seem to rule over
the Gentiles are lording it over them, and their great ones are wielding authority over them. 10:43 But
it will not be so among you°, but rather, whoever wishes to become great among you° will be your°
servant; 10:44 and whoever may wish to become first: he will be bondservant of all. 10:45 For* the Son
of Man also came, not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a redemption in exchange-for
many.

considerable crowd, Bartimaeus, the blind son of Timaeus, was sitting and begging beside the road.
10:47
       And having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, son of David,
show-mercy on me. 10:48 And many were rebuking him in-order-that he should be silent, but he was
crying out much more, Son of David, show-mercy to me.
     10:49
            And Jesus stood still and said for him to be summoned.

           And Jesus answered and says to him, What do you wish that I might do* for you?
    Now the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that* I may recover my sight.

           Now Jesus said to him, Proceed-away; your faith has cured you. And immediately he
recovered his sight and was following Jesus on the road.

young-donkey to Jesus and cast their garments upon it, and he sat upon it. 11:8 But many spread their
garments onto the road, and others were cutting leafage from the trees and were spreading them in
the road. 11:9 And the ones who precede him and the ones who are following him, were crying out,
saying, Hosanna; the one coming in the name of the Lord has been blessed! 11:10 The kingdom, the

answered and said to it, No one may eat fruit from you; no longer, forever. And his disciples were

Whenever they rise* up in the resurrection, whose wife will she be of them? For* the seven had her
as their wife.

neither marry, nor are they betrothed, but are like messengers the ones in the heavens. 12:26 But

ones who are in Judea, let° them flee to the mountains; 13:15 and let the one who is upon the housetop
not go-down into the house, nor let him enter in to take anything out-of his house; 13:16 and let the one

created until now, and should never happen again. 13:20 And except that the Lord shortened the days,
not any flesh would have been saved, but because of the chosen, whom he chose, he shortened the
days. 13:21 Then if anyone says to you°, Behold, here is the Christ; or, Behold, there; do° not believe°
it; 13:22 for* false* Christs and false* prophets will be raised and will be giving signs and wonders, if

            But no one knows concerning that day or hour, not even the messengers in heaven, neither
the Son, except the Father only. 13:33 Beware°, watch° and pray°; for* you° do not know when the time
is. 13:34 It is like a man, going-abroad, having left his house and given authority to his bondservants,
and his work to each one, and he commanded the doorkeeper in-order-that he may watch. 13:35
Therefore, watch°; for* you° do not know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening
or midnight or rooster’s crowing or in the morning; 13:36 lest having come suddenly, he might find
you° sleeping. 13:37 Now what I say to you°, I say to all, Watch°!

having an alabaster flask of costly full-strength perfume of nard, and she crushed the alabaster flask
and poured it down on his head. 14:4 But some were being indignant with themselves, and saying, *For
why has the waste of this perfume happened? 14:5 For* this perfume was able to be sold* for above
three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they were scolding her.
     14:6
          But Jesus said, Allow° her. Why are you° harassing her? She has worked a good work in me.
14:7
      For* you° always have the poor with yourselves, and whenever you° wish, you° are able to do*
them well, but you° do not always have me. 14:8 What this one had, she did*. She took upon herself

disciples say to him, After we have gone, where do you wish that we should prepare in-order-that
you might eat the Passover?
     14:13
            And he sends two of his disciples and says to them, Proceed° into the city and you° will be
encountering a man bearing a pitcher of water there. Follow° him. 14:14 And wherever he enters, say°
to the householder, The Teacher says, Where is the guestroom, where I may eat the Passover with

          And while they themselves are reclining and eating, Jesus said, Assuredly I am saying to you°,
One out-of you° will be giving me up to the Jews, the one eating with me.
    14:19
           Now they began to be sorrowful and to say to him every one {Or: one by one}, It is not I, is it?
And another, It is not I, is it?
    14:20
           But he answered and said to them, It is one out-of the twelve, he who dips with me in the
        14:21
dish.         The Son of Man indeed proceeds-away, just-as it has been written concerning him, but woe

it to them and said, Take°, eat°; this is my body. 14:23 And having taken the cup and having given-
thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank out-of it. 14:24 And he said to them, This is my blood,
the blood of the new covenant*, which is poured out concerning many. 14:25 Assuredly I am saying

           And having sung a hymn, they went forth to the Mountain of Olives.

           And Jesus says to them, All of you° will be offended at me in this night, because it has been
written, ‘I will be striking the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.’ {Zec 13:7} 14:28 But after the
time for me to be raised, I will be preceding you° into Galilee.
    14:29
           But Peter said to him, Even if all will be offended, but not I.

          And Jesus says to him, Assuredly I am saying to you, that today, even in this night, before the
rooster is to crow twice, you will be denying me three-times.
    14:31
          But Peter spoke rather exceptionally, If it should be essential for me to die together-with you,
I should never deny you! Now likewise*, they also all were saying it.
    14:32
           And they come to a parcel of ground of which the name is Gethsemane, and he says to his
disciples, Sit° here until I should pray. 14:33 And he takes Peter and James and John with himself, and
he began to be utterly amazed and disheartened. 14:34 And he says to them, My soul is very sorrowful
until death, remain° here and watch°.
    14:35
           And having gone a little further, he fell upon the earth and was praying in-order-that, if it is
possible, the hour might pass-away from him. 14:36 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible
for you; carry this cup away from me, but not what I will, but what you will.
    14:37
          And he comes and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Were you not
strong-enough to watch one hour? 14:38 Watch° and pray°, in-order-that you° may not enter into

temptation. The spirit is indeed eager, but the flesh is weak.
    14:39
          And again he went away and prayed, and said the same speech.
   14:40
          And having returned, he found them sleeping again, for* their eyes were heavy, and they did
not know what they should answer him.
   14:41
          And while coming the third-time, he says to them, Furthermore, are you° sleeping and resting
yourselves? It is adequate.
   The hour came already. Behold, the Son of Man is given up into the hands of sinners. 14:42 Arise°,
we should proceed. Behold, the one giving me up has drawn near.

          And immediately, as he is still speaking, Judas, being one of the twelve, comes* and with
him, a large crowd with swords and clubs from the high-priests, and the scribes and the elders. 14:44
Now the one giving him up, had given them a predefined gesture, saying, Whomever I kiss, it is he;
take-hold° of him and securely lead° him away. 14:45 And having gone to the place, he went
immediately to him and says to him, Rabbi, rabbi, and kissed him. 14:46 Now they put hands upon him
and took-hold of him.
    14:47
          But a certain one of the ones standing beside him, pulled the sword, he had, and struck the
bondservant of the high-priest and took off his ear.
   14:48
          And Jesus answered and said to them, Did you° come forth, as against a robber with swords
and clubs to take me? 14:49 I was with you° daily teaching in the temple and you° have not taken-hold
of me, but this is done in-order-that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.

          And they all left him and fled. 14:51 And one, a certain young-man followed with him, having
been dressed in a linen cloth over his naked body, and the young-men take-hold of him; 14:52 but he
left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.

scribes are coming together-with him there.
   {Mar 14:54 & Mat 26:58 & Luk 22:54b-62 & Joh 18:15-18 Courtyard of High Priest’s residence, Fri. around dawn.}

          And Peter followed him from afar, until he was inside, into the courtyard of the high-priest,
and he was sitting together with the attendants and warming himself in the light of the fire.
    {Mar 14:55-65 & Mat 26:59-68 & Luk 22:63-65.}
   14:55
          Now the high-priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus, *that* they
might slay him, and they were not finding it. 14:56 For* many were falsely testifying against him, and
yet their testimonies were not equal. 14:57 And some, having stood up, were falsely testifying against
him, saying, 14:58 We heard him say, I will be tearing-down this temple, the one made* with hands,
and I will be building another through three days not made* with hands. 14:59 And thus, neither was
their testimony equal.
    14:60
          And the high-priest having stood up in the midst of them, asked Jesus, saying, Are you
answering nothing? What are these witnesses testifying against you? 14:61 But he was silent and

answered nothing. Again the high-priest was asking him and says to him, Are you the Christ, the Son
of the Gracious* One?
    14:62
           But Jesus said, I am, and you° will be seeing the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power
and coming with the clouds of heaven.
     14:63
           But the high-priest, having ripped his tunics, says, Why do we still have need of witnesses?
14:64
      You° have heard the blasphemy. What does it appear to you°? Now they all condemned him to
be liable of death. 14:65 And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to batter him, and
to say to him, Prophesy! And the attendants were casting him around with slaps on the cheek.

    14:66
           And Peter being below in the courtyard, one of the maidservants of the high-priest comes. 14:67
And having seen Peter warming himself, she looked at him and says, You were also with Jesus, the
Nazarene.
     14:68
           But he denied it, saying, I do not know him, nor know what you are saying, and he went
outside into the forecourt, and the rooster crowed.
     14:69
           And the maidservant saw him and began again to say to the ones standing beside her, This
one is from them. 14:70 But he again was denying it. And after a little while, the ones standing beside
them were again saying to Peter, You truly are from them. For* you are a Galilean and your speech
is similar.
    14:71
           But he began to curse and swear, I do not know this man of whom you° are speaking. 14:72 And
the rooster crowed the second-time. And Peter was reminded of the declaration which Jesus said to
him, Before the rooster is to crow twice, you will be denying me three-times. And having put his
thoughts upon it, he was weeping.

are testifying against you. 15:5 But Jesus no more answered anything; so-then making Pilate to marvel.

were asking for. 15:7 Now there was one called* Barabbas, having been bound with the fellow rioters
of his, who in the riot had practiced murder. 15:8 And the crowd having cried out, began to ask him

to do like he was doing* habitually for them. 15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you° wish that
I might release to you° the King of the Jews? 15:10 For* he knew that the high-priests had given him
up because of envy. 15:11 But the high-priests shook up the crowd, in-order-that he should rather
release Barabbas to them. 15:12 And Pilate again answered and said to them, Therefore, what do you°
wish that I might do* to the one whom you° call* the King of the Jews?
     15:13
           But they cried out again, Crucify him!
     15:14
           But Pilate said to them, For* what evil did he do*?
    But they cried out even-more, Crucify him. 15:15 Now Pilate, willing to do* what was sufficient for
the crowd, released to them Barabbas and gave up Jesus, having scourged him, in-order-that he might
be crucified.
     15:16
           Now the soldiers led him away, inside the courtyard, which is the palace, and they call
together the whole cohort {600 soldiers}. 15:17 And they clothe him with purple, and braided a thorny
crown, and they place it around his head; 15:18 and they began to greet him, Hail, King of the Jews!
15:19
      And they were beating his head with a reed and were spitting on him, and placing the knees
down, they were worshiping him.
     {Mar 15:20-23 & Mat 27:31-34 & Luk 23:26-33 & Joh 19:17 Road to the Cross, Fri. morning.}
     15:20
           And when they had mocked him, they stripped the purple off him and clothed him with his
own garments. And they lead him out in-order-that they should crucify him. 15:21 And they compel
a certain one passing by, Simon from Cyrene, coming from the rural-area, the father of Alexander
and Rufus, to go with them, in-order-that he might lift up his cross. 15:22 And they bring him upon the
place called Golgotha, which is, after being translated, The place of a skull. 15:23 And they were
giving to him wine to drink, having been medicated with myrrh, but he did not take it.

each might take. {Psa 22:18} 15:25 Now it was the third hour {i.e., 9:00 AM} and they crucified him. 15:26
And the inscription of his accusation was written upon the cross, The King of the Jews. 15:27 And they
crucify two robbers together-with him; one at his right and one at his left. 15:28 And the Scripture was
fulfilled, the one saying ‘And he was counted with the lawless.’ {Isa 53:12} 15:29 ‘And the ones who
are traveling by were blaspheming him, wagging their heads’ and saying, Aha! He who will tear-
down the temple and build it in three days; 15:30 ‘save yourself and come-down from the cross.’ {Psa
22:7}
     15:31
           Likewise, also, the high-priests with the scribes were mocking him with one another, and
were saying, He saved others, but he is not able to save himself. 15:32 Let the Christ, the King of
Israel, come-down now from the cross, in-order-that we may see and may believe in him. And the
ones who have been crucified together-with him were reproaching him.

summoning Elijah. 15:36 But one having ran and filled a sponge from the vinegar vessel, placed it
around a reed and was delivering a drink to him, saying, Allow° it, that we may see if Elijah comes
to take him down.
     15:37
            But Jesus expired, having left with a loud voice. 15:38 And the curtain of the temple was split-
apart, into two pieces, from the top to the bottom. 15:39 Now the centurion* standing there, opposite
from him, saw that he thus cried out and expired, said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 15:40 Now
there were also women viewing from afar, among whom were both Mary the Magdalene and Mary
the mother of James the little {Or: least} and of Joses and Salome; 15:41 who also, when he was in
Galilee, were following him and were serving him, and many other women who came-up together-

the Sabbath, 15:43 Joseph, a prominent counselor, came, who was from Arimathaea, who himself was
also waiting for the kingdom of God, and having dared, he entered to Pilate and asked for the body
of Jesus. 15:44 Now Pilate marveled if already, he has died. And having called the centurion*, he asked
him if he had died for very-long. 15:45 And having known this from the centurion*, he bestowed the
body to Joseph as a gift. 15:46 And having bought a linen cloth and having taken him down, he coiled
him in the linen cloth, and placed him in a tomb which was hewed out-of a rock, and he rolled a
stone against the door of the tomb. 15:47 Now Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were
viewing where he is placed.

Salome bought spices in-order-that after they went there, they might anoint him.
     16:2
          And exceedingly early in the morning of the first day of the week, they are coming upon the
tomb after the sun rose. 16:3 And they were saying to themselves, Who will be rolling away the stone
from the door of the tomb for us? 16:4 And having looked up, they view that the stone has been rolled
away; for* it was extremely great. 16:5 And having entered into the tomb, they saw a young-man
sitting at the right side, having been dressed in a white robe, and they were utterly amazed.

who has been crucified. He was raised. He is not here. Behold, the place where they had placed him.

                                            {{ Introduction to Luke 60-62 AD
    The Good-news account by Luke was written from a historian’s point of view to Theophilus, Gentiles, and people
everywhere. This doctor, a close friend of Paul, a Greek and Gentile Christian and the only Gentile writer in the New
Testament was very specific when describing when and where things took place. As such, Luke is the most detail-
oriented of the four Good-news accounts. Beginning with the miraculous birth of John (a relative of Jesus) and Jesus’
own birth six months later, Luke reveals the life of Jesus in a very orderly manner. Luke demonstrates how the Holy
Spirit promotes belief in Jesus as the Son of God in an accurate account of the life of Christ presenting Christ as the
perfect human savior. Luke also influences his readers through various elements of a narrative text of Scripture that is
written from Rome or possibly Caesarea. A key verse in Luke is 19: 9, 10 and our Lord and Savior’s mission to save
mankind. Luke stresses the Savior’s relationship with people. It is in this biography of Jesus that we see Jesus foretelling
the completion of the Old Testament in the lifetime of the people to whom He spoke (Luke 20:21-22). Jesus’ final
instructions to His apostles, after His resurrection, were ‘Repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in My
name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem’ (Luke 24:47, shown in Acts 2:38). Luke also wrote Acts: The Book
of Conversions.}}

         Since many undertook the task to compile a narrative concerning the matters which have been
fully assured among us, 1:2 just-as they gave them to us, the ones who became eyewitnesses and
attendants of the word from the beginning, 1:3 it also seemed good to me, having followed accurately
in all things from the start, to write to you afterwards, most-excellent Theophilus, 1:4 in-order-that
you might fully know the certainty concerning the words of which you were instructed.
     {Luk 1:5-25 Jerusalem 6 BC; no parallel.}
     1:5
          It happened in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, there was a certain priest, Zacharias by
name, from the class* of Abijah and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron and her name was
Elisabeth. 1:6 Now they were both righteous and blameless in God’s sight, conducting-themselves
in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. 1:7 And there was no child to them, insomuch
as Elisabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.
     1:8
         Now it happened, while* he was doing priestly duties in front of God in the order of his class*,
1:9
    according-to the custom of the priest’s office, he was allotted to burn-incense, after he entered into
the temple of the Lord. 1:10 And all the multitude of the people were praying outside in the hour of
incense. 1:11 And a messenger of the Lord was seen by him, standing at the right side of the altar of
incense. 1:12 And Zacharias, having seen him, was disturbed, and fear fell upon him.
     1:13
           But the messenger said to him, Do not fear, Zacharias, because your supplication was heard
and your wife Elisabeth will be giving-birth to a son to you and you will call his name John. 1:14 And
there will be joy and gladness to you, and many will be rejoicing at his birth. 1:15 For* he will be great
in the Lord’s sight, and he should never drink wine and liquor, and he will be filled more with the
Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb. 1:16 And he will be turning many of the sons of Israel over
to the Lord their God. 1:17 And he will be going beforehand, in his sight, in the spirit and power of
Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers again to their children, and to turn the disobedient in the
prudence of the righteous; to make-ready a people who have been prepared for the Lord.
      1:18
            And Zacharias said to the messenger, According-to what will I know this? For* I am an
elderly-man and my wife has advanced in her days.
     1:19
           And the messenger answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands in God’s sight, and

I was sent to speak to you and to proclaim to you good-news with these things. 1:20 And behold, you
will be silent and not able to speak, till the day that these things should happen, because you did not
believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.
     1:21
          And the people were expecting Zacharias and they were marveling while* he himself was
delaying in the temple. 1:22 But after he went forth, he was not able to speak to them, and they
recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple, and he himself was signaling to them and was
remaining mute. 1:23 And it happened, as the days of his ministry* were fulfilled, he went away to his
house.
     1:24
          Now after these days, Elisabeth his wife conceived, and she was hiding herself for five
months, saying, 1:25 Thus the Lord has done* to me in the days in which he looked upon me, to take
away my reproach among men.
     {Luk 1:26-38 Nazareth 5 BC; no parallel.}
     1:26
          Now in the sixth month Gabriel the messenger was sent by God to a city of Galilee, to which
is the name Nazareth, 1:27 to a virgin who has been engaged to a man to which is the name Joseph,
from the house of David, and Mary is the name of the virgin. 1:28 And the messenger entered to her,
said, Hail! She who has been favored. The Lord is with you. You have been blessed among women.
1:29
      But having seen him, she was very disturbed at his speech, and was reasoning what sort of
greeting this might be. 1:30 And the messenger said to her, Do not fear, Mary; for* you found favor
with God. 1:31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and will be bearing a son and will call
his name Jesus. 1:32 This one will be great and will be called the Son of the Highest and the Lord God
will be giving to him the throne of his father David, 1:33 and he will be reigning over the house of
Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.
     1:34
          But Mary said to the messenger, How will this be, since I do not know a man sexually?
     1:35
          And the messenger answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the
power of the Highest will be overshadowing you; hence the holy one being born out-of you will also
be called the Son of God. 1:36 And behold, Elisabeth your relative, she herself also has conceived a
son in her elderliness, and this is the sixth month with her, the one being called barren, 1:37 because
every declaration from God will not be powerless.
     1:38
          But Mary said, Behold, the bondservant of the Lord; let it happen to me according-to your
declaration. And the messenger went away from her.
        {Luk 1:39-80 Hill region of Judea, 5 BC; no parallel.}
     1:39
          Now having risen* up in these days, Mary traveled with diligence into the hill-country, into
a city of Judah, 1:40 and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elisabeth. 1:41 And it
happened, as Elisabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby jumped in her womb, and Elisabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit; 1:42 and she shouted out with a loud voice and said, You have been blessed
among women, and the fruit of your womb has been blessed. 1:43 And from where did this come to
me, in-order-that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 1:44 For* behold, as the voice of your
greeting came* into my ears, the baby jumped in my womb in gladness. 1:45 And she who believed
is fortunate, because there will be a completion of the things which have been spoken to her from
the Lord.
     1:46
          And Mary said, My soul applauds the Lord, 1:47 and my spirit was glad upon God my Savior.

his name is holy, 1:50 and his mercy is toward generations of generations to the ones who fear him.
1:51
     He made* his dominion known with* his arm. He scattered the haughty in the perception of their
heart. 1:52 He took down sovereigns from their thrones and has exalted the humble. 1:53 He filled the
hungry with good things, and he sent out the rich empty. 1:54 He helped Israel his young-servant, in
order to remember his mercy, 1:55 just-as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever.
     1:56
          Now Mary remained together-with her approximately three months and returned to her house.
     1:57
          Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled for her to bear, and she gave-birth to a son. 1:58 And the
dwellers around her, and her relatives, heard that the Lord was magnifying his mercy with her, and
they were rejoicing together-with her. 1:59 And it happened on the eighth day; they came to circumcise
the child, and they were to be calling it upon {i.e., after} the name of his father, Zacharias. 1:60 And his
mother answered and said, Not so, but he will be called John.
     1:61
          And they said to her, There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name. 1:62 But
they were signaling to his father, what he would wish him to be called. 1:63 And he asked for a
writing-tablet and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled. 1:64 Now his mouth was
instantly opened, and his tongue loosed, and he was speaking, thanking God. 1:65 And fear came*
upon all the ones dwelling around them and all these declarations were being talked-about in the
whole hill-country of Judea. 1:66 And all who heard, placed these in their heart, saying, What then will
this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
     1:67
          And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying, 1:68 The Lord,
the God of Israel is gracious*. Because he visited and made* redemption for his people. 1:69 And lifted
up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his young-servant David, 1:70 (just-as he spoke through
the mouth of his holy prophets from the age past). 1:71 We have salvation from our enemies and from
the hand of all who hate us, 1:72 to do* his mercy with our fathers and to remember his holy covenant*.
1:73
      We have the oath which he had sworn to Abraham our father to give to us, 1:74 having been
fearlessly rescued out-of the hand of our enemies, to give-divine-service to him 1:75 in holiness and
righteousness all the days of our life in his sight. 1:76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the
Highest; for* ‘you will be traveling before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways.’ {Mal 3:1} 1:77 You
are to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins, 1:78 through the heart*
of mercy of our God, in which the rising of light from on high visited us, 1:79 to appear to the ones
sitting in darkness and the shadow of death; to steer our feet into the way of peace.

          Now the child was growing and becoming-powerful in spirit and was in the wilderness until
the day of his public showing to Israel.

Galilee, out-of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
because he himself is out-of the house and family of David; 2:5 to register himself together-with
Mary, who has been engaged to him as his wife, being swollen with child {i.e., pregnant}. 2:6 Now it

another, We should go through, insofar as Bethlehem, and let us see this declaration about events

         But the people are expecting, and all are reasoning in their hearts concerning John, maybe,
he himself might be the Christ; 3:16 John answered, saying to them all, I indeed immerse* you° in
water, but the mightier one than I, he is coming, the strap of whose shoes I am not sufficient to
loose. He himself will immerse* you° in the Holy Spirit, and in fire; 3:17 whose winnowing fan is in
his hand, and he will be thoroughly cleansing his threshing floor, and will be gathering the grain into
his barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.

with many other things.

while praying, the heaven opened, 3:22 and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form, like a dove upon
him, and a voice came* from heaven, saying, You are my beloved Son. I am delighted in you.

         Now full of the Holy Spirit, Jesus returned from the Jordan, and was being led by the Spirit into
the wilderness, 4:2 being tempted by the devil for forty days. And he ate nothing in those days, and
later, after they themselves were completed, he hungered. 4:3 And the devil said to him, If you are
the Son of God, speak to this stone in-order-that it may become bread.

          And the devil, having led him up into a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the
inhabited-earth in an instant of time. 4:6 And the devil said to him, I will be giving all this authority,

wish. 4:7 Therefore, if you worship only in my sight, all this will be yours.

their hands, lest you might hit your foot with a stone.’ {Psa 91:11-12}

           And he came to Nazareth, where he was being reared up, and according-to his custom, he
entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read. 4:17 And the scroll of the prophet
Isaiah was given to him. And having unrolled the scroll, he found the place where it had been
written, 4:18 ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because of which, he anointed me to proclaim the
good-news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the crushed in heart, to preach deliverance to the
captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send forth the downtrodden to deliverance, 4:19 to
preach the acceptable year of the Lord.’ {Isa 61:1-2} 4:20 And having furled the scroll, he gave back to
the attendant. He sat down, and the eyes of all were staring at him in the synagogue. 4:21 But he began
to say to them, This Scripture has been fulfilled today in your° ears.
     4:22
           And all were testifying of him, and were marveling at the words of favor which are traveling
from his mouth, and they were saying, Is this not Joseph’s son?
     4:23
           And he said to them, You° will certainly say this parable to me, Physician, heal yourself. We
heard how-much had happened in Capernaum, do* it here also in your fatherland. 4:24 But he said,
Assuredly I am saying to you°, No prophet is acceptable in his fatherland. 4:25 But in truth I say to
you°, Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was locked for three years
and six months, as such a great famine over all the land happened; 4:26 and Elijah was sent to none
of them, except to Zarephath from Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. 4:27 And many lepers were
in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except Naaman the
Syrian.
     4:28
           And they were all filled with fury in the synagogue, while hearing these things; 4:29 and having
         *
risen up, they cast him forth outside the city, and led him to the brow of the mountain upon which
their city had been built, *that* they might propel him off the cliff. 4:30 But he himself went through
the middle of them; he was traveling away.
     {Mar 1:21-28 & Luk 4:31-37 Capernaum.}

           And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the
Sabbath; 4:32 and they were being astounded at his teaching, because his word was with* authority.
4:33
     And a man was in the synagogue, who has a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with
a loud voice, 4:34 saying, Ah! What is this thing to us and to you, Jesus the Nazarene? Did you come
to destroy us? I know you, who you are, the Holy One of God.
     4:35
           And Jesus rebuked it, saying, Hush and come forth out-of him. And after the demon tossed
him into the middle of them, he came away from him, having not harmed him.
     4:36
           And amazement came* upon all, and they were speaking together with one another, saying,
What is this word, because he commands the unclean spirits with* authority and power, and they
come forth? 4:37 And a rumor was traveling out concerning him, into every place of the region around.

stood above her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and instantly, she rose* up and was serving
them.

to him, and having laid his hands upon each one of them, he healed them. 4:41 Now demons were also
coming forth from many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God. And rebuking
them, he was not permitting them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.

          Now after it became day, he went forth and traveled into a desolate place, and the crowds were
seeking him and came to him, and were holding-onto him to not travel away from them. 4:43 But he
said to them, It is essential for me to also proclaim the good-news of the kingdom of God to the other
cities, because I have been sent forth to this end.
     4:44
          And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

          Now it happened, while* the crowd was jamming against him to hear the word of God, and
while he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret; 5:2 and he saw two ships standing empty beside
the lake, but the fishermen, having stepped away from them, rinsed their nets. 5:3 Now he stepped
onto one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and asked him to set-sail a few feet from the land. And
having sat down, he was teaching the crowds out-of the ship. 5:4 Now as he ceased speaking, he said
to Simon, Set-sail into the deep and lower° your° nets *for a catch.
     5:5
          And Simon answered and said to him, Master*, we labored through the whole night and took
nothing, but at your declaration I will lower the net. 5:6 And having done* this, they locked up
together a large multitude of fish, and their net was being ripped; 5:7 and they signaled to their
companions, the ones who had come in the other ship to help them. And they came and filled both
the ships, so-then they are about to be submerged. 5:8 But having seen it, Simon Peter fell down
before Jesus’ knees, saying, Go away from me, because I am a man, a sinner, Lord. 5:9 For*
amazement engulfed him and all the ones together-with him, at the catch of the fish which they took;
5:10
     and likewise also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
     And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear; from hereafter you will be catching live men. 5:11 And
having brought* the ships upon the land, and having left it all, they followed him.

          And it happened, while* he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy. And after
he saw Jesus, he fell upon his face, and besought of him, saying, Lord, if you should will it, you are
able to cleanse me.
     5:13
          And having stretched out his hand, he touched him, and said, I am willing; be cleansed. And
immediately the leprosy went away from him. 5:14 And he commanded him to speak to no one,
saying, But after you have gone away, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift concerning your
cleansing, just-as Moses commanded, *for a testimony to them. {Lev 13:49 and 14:2-4}
     5:15
          But the word concerning him was going through the land even more, and large crowds were
coming together to hear and to be healed by him from their sicknesses. 5:16 But he was departing by
himself in the wilderness and was praying.

teachers of the law were sitting, who had come out-of every village of Galilee and Judea and
Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was there, *that* he might heal them.
   5:18
         And behold, some men are carrying a man who was paralyzed upon a cot, and they were
seeking to bring him in and to place him in his sight. 5:19 And having not found from what way, that
they might bring him in because of the crowd, they went-up to the housetop and dropped him down
through the tiles together-with the cot, into the middle, before Jesus. 5:20 And having seen their faith,
he said to him, Man, your sins have been forgiven to you.
   5:21
         And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this one, who is speaking
blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins, except God only?

         But Jesus, having fully known their reasonings, answered and said to them, What are you°
reasoning in your° hearts? 5:23 What is easier, to say, Your sins have been forgiven to you; or to say,
Lift yourself up and walk? 5:24 But in-order-that you° may know that the Son of Man has authority
upon the earth to forgive sins (he said to the one who has been paralyzed), I say to you, Lift yourself
up! And after you have taken up your cot, travel to your house! 5:25 And instantly he stood up in their
sight, after he lifted up that upon which he was reclining, he went away to his house, glorifying God.

         And Levi made* for himself a great banquet in his house and there was a large crowd of tax
collectors and others who were reclining at the meal with them. 5:30 And the Pharisees and their
scribes were murmuring to his disciples, saying, Why do you° eat and drink with the tax collectors
and sinners?
   5:31
         And Jesus answered and said to them, The ones who are healthy have no need of a physician,
but the ones who have illness. 5:32 I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
    5:33
          But they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast frequently and are making*
supplications; likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?
   5:34
         But he said to them, You° are not able to make* the sons of the bridal-party {companions or
guests} to fast, in which time the bridegroom is with them, are they? 5:35 But the days also will come
whenever the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will be fasting in those days.
   5:36
         But he also spoke a parable to them: No one puts a patch from a new garment upon an old
garment; otherwise, the new and old will split-apart and also the patch from the new will not agree
together-with the old. 5:37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will
burst the old wineskins, and it will be poured out and the wineskins will be destroyed. 5:38 But new
wine is put into new wineskins, and both are protected together. 5:39 And no one having drunk old
wine, immediately wishes for new; for* he says, The old is smoother.

up and stand, you in the middle! Now he rose* up, and stood there. 6:9 Therefore, Jesus said to them,
I will ask you° something, Is it legal on the Sabbath to do good or to do* evil? To save a life or to kill
it? 6:10 And having looked around at them all, he said to him, Stretch out your hand. Now he did*, and

eye, while you yourself do not see the beam the one in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast forth the
beam first out-of your own eye, and then you will see precisely to cast forth the speck the one in your
brother’s eye.

          For* there is not a good tree producing rotten fruit; nor is there a rotten tree producing good
fruit. For* each tree is known from its own fruit. For* they do not collect figs from thorns, nor do
         6:44
they pick a grape-cluster from a bush. 6:45 The good man out-of the good treasure of his heart brings
forth what is good, and the evil man out-of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth what is evil; for*
his mouth speaks out-of the abundance of the heart.

         Now why are you° calling me, Lord, Lord and yet do not practice the things which I say? 6:47
Everyone who comes to me and hears my words, and is practicing them, I will show you° to whom
he is similar. 6:48 He is similar to a man building a house, who dug and then deepened and placed its
foundation upon the rock, and after a deluge happened, the river bursts against that house and was
not strong-enough to shake it; for* it had been founded upon the rock. 6:49 But he who heard and did*
not, is similar to a man who built a house upon the soil without a foundation; which the river bursts
against, and immediately it fell, and the breakup of that house became great.

    7:1
         Now since he had fulfilled all his declarations in the ears of the people, he entered into
Capernaum. 7:2 Now a certain centurion’s bondservant, who was precious to him, having an illness,
was about to die*. 7:3 Now having heard things concerning Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews;
requesting of him, *that after he has come to him, he might cure his bondservant. 7:4 Now when they
came* to Jesus, they were pleading with him diligently, saying, He is worthy to whom you will be
providing this; 7:5 for* he loves* our nation and he himself built us the synagogue.
   7:6
        Now Jesus was traveling together-with them. Now already, while he is not far distant from the
house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, do not be bothered; for* I am not
sufficient that* you should enter under my roof. 7:7 Hence, not even I myself deemed it worthy to
come to you, but say it with a word, and my young-servant will be healed. 7:8 For* I am also a man
appointed under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I say to this one, Travel and he travels,
and to another, Come and he comes, and to my bondservant, Do* this and he does* it.
    7:9
         Now having heard these things, Jesus marveled at him and turned and said to the crowd
following him, I say to you°, Not even in Israel, did I found so-great a faith. 7:10 And the ones who
were sent, having returned to the house, found the sick bondservant healthy.
   {Luk 7:11-17 At Nain in Galilee; no parallel.}
    7:11
          And it happened on the next day, that he was traveling to a city called Nain, and his
considerable number of disciples and a large crowd was traveling together-with him. 7:12 Now as he
drew near to the gate of the city, behold also, one who has died, was being entombed, the only
begotten son of his mother and she herself was a widow and a considerable crowd from the city was
together-with her. 7:13 And the Lord, having seen her, had compassion upon her and said to her, Do
not weep. 7:14 And he came near and touched the funeral bier, and the ones bearing it stopped. Now
he said, Young-man, I say to you, Arise.
    7:15
         And the previously dead one sat up and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother. 7:16
Now fear took all and they were glorifying God, saying, A great prophet has been raised up among
us, and that God visited his people. 7:17 And this word went forth concerning him in the whole region
of Judea, and in all the region around.
   {Mat 11:2-30 & Luk 7:18-35 Galilee.}
   7:18
         And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things. 7:19 And John, having
called to him a certain two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you the one who is
coming or are we expecting another?

     7:20
          Now after the men came* to him, they said, John the Immerser* sent us to you, saying, Are you
the one who is coming or are we expecting another? 7:21 He healed many from their diseases and
disorders and evil spirits in the same hour, and he granted to many of the blind to see.
     7:22
          And Jesus answered and said to them, After traveling back, report° to John the things which
      °
you saw and heard; that the blind recover their sight, the lame are walking, the lepers are cleansed,
the mute hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the good-news proclaimed to them. 7:23 And
whoever is not offended in me is fortunate.
     7:24
          Now after the messengers of John went away, he began to say to the crowds concerning John,
What have you° gone forth into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 7:25 But what have
you° gone forth to see? A man who has been dressed-up in soft garments? Behold, the ones who are
in a glorious garment and being* in splendor, they are in the royal courts. 7:26 But what have you°
gone forth to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you°, And more-than a prophet. 7:27 This is he concerning
whom it has been written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will be preparing
your way before you. {Mal 3:1} 7:28 For* I say to you°, Among those born of women there is no prophet
greater than John the Immerser*; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 7:29
And all the people and the tax collectors, having heard this, made {i.e., showed} God righteous, having
been immersed* in the immersion* of John. 7:30 But the Pharisees and the professors of the law
rejected the plan of God *for themselves, were not immersed* by him. 7:31 Therefore, in what will be
similar to the men of this generation, and in what are they similar? 7:32 They are similar to children,
the ones sitting in the marketplace and are shouting to one another and saying, We piped to you° and
you° did not dance; we mourned for you° and you° did not weep. 7:33 For* John the Immerser* has
come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you° say, He has a demon. 7:34 The Son of Man has
come eating and drinking, and you° say, Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors
and sinners! 7:35 And wisdom was made righteous from all her children.
     {Luk 7:36-50 Galilee; no parallel.}
     7:36
          Now someone of the Pharisees were asking him in-order-that he might eat with him. And
having entered into the Pharisee’s house, he was reclining at a meal. 7:37 And behold, a woman who
was in the city, who was a sinner, after she recognized that he is reclining at a meal in the Pharisee’s
house, she fetched an alabaster flask of perfume, 7:38 and having stood behind him, beside his feet,
weeping, she began to rain on his feet with her tears and was wiping them with the hairs of her head
and was kissing his feet, and was anointing them with the perfume. 7:39 Now the Pharisee, who
invited him, saw it, and spoke in himself, saying, This one, if he were a prophet, would have known
who and what sort of person the woman is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.
     7:40
          And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you.
     But he says, Teacher, say it.
     7:41
          Two debtors were to a lender: a certain one was owing five hundred denarii and the other fifty.
7:42
      But after having nothing for themselves to repay him with, he forgave* them both. Therefore, tell
me who of them will love* him most?
     7:43
          But Simon answered and said, I am taking it as, he to whom he forgave* the most.
     But he said to him, You judged correctly.
     7:44
          And having turned to the woman, he said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into
your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but she rained upon my feet with her tears and wiped

them with the hairs of her head. 7:45 You gave me no kiss, but this woman, from which time I entered,
she did not refrain-for a moment kissing my feet. 7:46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but this
one, she anointed my feet with perfume. 7:47 Because of which, I say to you, Her sins, the many, have
been forgiven, because she loved* much, but to whom few is forgiven, the same loves* few. 7:48 Now
he said to her, Your sins have been forgiven.
      7:49
            And the ones who are reclining at the meal together-with him began to speak among
themselves, Who is this one, who forgives even sins?
     7:50
           But he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Travel in peace.

     8:1
          And it happened in the time afterwards also, that he was traveling through every city and
village, preaching and proclaiming the good-news of the kingdom of God and the twelve were
together-with him, 8:2 and some women who were healed from their evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary
who is called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone forth, 8:3 and Joanna the wife of
Chuza, Herod’s commissioner, and Susanna, and many others who were serving them from their
possessions with them.
     {Mar 4:1-25 & Mat 13:1-23 & Luk 8:4-18 Sea of Galilee.}
     8:4
         Now a large crowd was coming-together and he spoke through a parable to the ones who were
traveling to him from every city. 8:5 The sower went forth to sow his seed, and while* he was sowing,
some which fell beside the road, and it was trampled down and the birds of the heaven devoured it.
8:6
    And other seed fell upon the rock, and after it sprang up, it dried up, because it has no moisture.
8:7
    And other seed fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns sprang up together-with it and choked
it. 8:8 And other seed fell into the good soil, and it sprang up and produced fruit a hundred-times over.
While saying these things, he was shouting, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
     8:9
         But his disciples were asking him, saying, What might this parable be about?
     8:10
           But he said, It has been given to you° to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but it is
in parables to the rest; in-order-that seeing, they may not see; and hearing, they may not understand.
{Isa 6:9} 8:11 Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God. 8:12 But the ones beside the road are
the ones who hear; thereafter, the devil comes and takes the word from their heart in-order-that they
should not believe and be saved. 8:13 But the ones upon the rock are the ones who, whenever they
hear, accept the word with joy, and these have no root, who for a short time believe, and withdraw
in time of temptation. 8:14 But what fell into the thorns, these are the ones who heard, and while they
are traveling on with life, they are choked by anxieties and riches and sensual-delights of this life,
and they are not bringing themselves to maturity. 8:15 But the seed in the good soil, these are they who
have heard the word in a beautiful and good heart, and hold-onto it and are bearing-fruit in their
endurance.
     8:16
           Now no one, having lit a lamp, hides it in a vessel or places it underneath a bed, but places it
upon a lamp-stand in-order-that the ones who travel into there may see the light. 8:17 For* not
anything is hidden, which will not become apparent; nor anything hidden, which will not be known
and should come into apparent view. 8:18 Therefore, beware°, how you° hear; for* whoever has, more
will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken from

     8:19
          Now his mother and brethren came* to him, and they were not able to get-close to him because
of the crowd. 8:20 And it was reported to him, saying, Your mother and your brethren are standing
outside, wishing to see you.
     8:21
          But he answered and said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word
of God and are doing* it.

          And it happened on one of the days, that he stepped onto a ship, himself and his disciples, and
he said to them, We should go through toward the area beyond-that of the lake. And they did set-sail.
8:23
     But while sailing, he slept and a gale of wind descended onto the lake, and they were being filled
and were in peril.
     8:24
          Now having gone to him, they awakened him, saying, Master*, Master*! We are perishing. But
having raised himself up, he rebuked the wind and the wave of the water, and they ceased, and it
became calm.
     8:25
          Now he said to them, Where is your° faith?
     But they were afraid and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that he commands
even the winds and the water and they are obeying* him?

     8:26
          And they sailed down to the region of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. 8:27 Now after
he {i.e., Jesus} went forth upon the land, a certain man out-of the city met him, who was holding
demons, and he was not clothing himself with a garment in considerable times {i.e., a long time} and
was not abiding in any house, but lived in the tombs. 8:28 Now having seen Jesus and having cried
out, he fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, What is this thing with me and with you,
Jesus, Son of the Highest God? I beseech of you. Do not torment me. 8:29 For* he commanded the
unclean spirit to come forth from the man. For* it had seized him many times, and he was being
bound in chains and shackles, and being guarded; and ripping the bonds, he was being driven by the
demon into the wilderness.
     8:30
          Now Jesus asked him, saying, What name is in you?
     Now he said, Legion. (Because many demons had entered into him.) 8:31 And he was pleading
with him in-order-that he might not command them to go away into the abyss. 8:32 Now a
considerable herd of swine was there, being fed at the mountain. And he was pleading with him in-
order-that he might permit* them to enter into those swine. And he permitted* them. 8:33 Now the
demons having gone forth from the man, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the cliff
into the lake and were choked to death. 8:34 Now after the ones feeding them saw what had happened,
they fled and reported it in the city and in the fields. 8:35 Now they went forth to see what had
happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man, from whom the demons had gone forth, sitting,
having on garments and being sensible, beside the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid. 8:36 But the
ones who saw it reported to them also, how he who was demon-possessed was cured. 8:37 And all the
multitude of the region around the Gadarenes asked him to go away from them, because they were
being held in great fear, and having stepped into the ship, he returned. 8:38 Now the man from whom

the demons had gone forth, was beseeching to be together-with him.
   But Jesus dismissed him, saying, 8:39 Return to your house, and describe how-much God did* for
you. And he went away, preaching in the whole city how-much Jesus did* for him.
    8:40
         Now it happened while* Jesus was returning, the crowd accepted him; for* they were all
expecting him.
   {Mar 5:22-43 & Mat 9:18-26 & Luk 8:41-56 Capernaum.}
   8:41
         And behold, a man to which is the name Jairus came, and he was* ruler of the synagogue, and
having fallen beside Jesus’ feet, he was pleading with him to enter into his house; 8:42 because there
was to him an only begotten daughter, approximately twelve years old, and this one was dying. But
while* he was proceeding-away, the crowds were choking him.
    8:43
         And a woman, having a flowing of blood from twelve years old, who consumed the whole
livelihood she had with physicians, was not strong-enough to be healed by anyone. 8:44 She came
near, behind him and touched the hem of his garment, and instantly, the flowing of her blood
stopped. 8:45 And Jesus said, Who touched my garment?
   But while all are denying it, Peter and the ones with him said, Master*, the crowds are crowding
together-with you, and are pressing against you and you say, Who touched my garment?
   8:46
         But Jesus said, Someone touched me; for* I knew that power went forth from me.
   8:47
         Now after the woman saw that she did not elude him, she came trembling, and having fallen
before him, reported to him in the sight of all the people, because of what cause she touched him and
how she was healed instantly.
   8:48
         Now he said to her, Have courage daughter, your faith has cured you; travel in peace.
   8:49
         While he himself is still speaking, someone from the ruler of the synagogue comes, saying to
him, Your daughter has died; do not bother the Teacher.
    8:50
         But Jesus having heard it, answered him, saying, Do not fear. Only believe and she will be
cured. 8:51 Now after he came into the house, he allowed no one to enter it, except Peter and John and
James, and the father and the mother of the child. 8:52 Now all were weeping and grieving her. But
he said, Do° not weep; she has not died, but is sleeping. 8:53 And they were laughing at him, knowing
that she had died. 8:54 But he himself, having cast everyone outside and having taken-hold of her
hand, shouted, saying, Child, arise. 8:55 And her spirit returned, and she rose* up instantly, and he
commanded something to be given to her to eat. 8:56 And her parents were astonished, but he
commanded them to speak what has happened to no one.

John, but who is this one, concerning whom I am hearing such things? Now he was seeking to see

to them concerning the kingdom of God, and he was healing the ones having the need of healing. 9:12
Now the day began to be far-spent, and the twelve came near and said to him, Dismiss the crowd in-
order-that after they have gone away into the surrounding villages and the rural-areas, and may
board and may find nutrition, because we are here in a desolate place.

          But he said to them, You°, give° them something to eat.
    But they said, There are not to us more than five loaves and two fish; unless after traveling back,
we should buy foods *for all this crowd of people. 9:14 For* they were approximately five thousand
men.
    Now he said to his disciples, Have° them recline in parties, approximately fifty apiece. 9:15 And
they did* so and they all reclined. 9:16 Now he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looked up
to heaven, he gave-thanks and broke them. And he was giving them to the disciples to place beside
the crowd. 9:17 And they ate and all were fully-fed, and twelve baskets of broken pieces were lifted
up, what was leftover by them.

high-priests and scribes, and to be killed and to rise* in the third day.

lose his life because of me, this one will be saving it. 9:25 For* what is a man profited, having gained

the form of his face became a different form, and his garment became white and dazzling. 9:30 And
behold, two men were speaking together-with him, who were Moses and Elijah; 9:31 who was seen
in glory, and were speaking of his exodus which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem. 9:32 Now Peter
and the ones together-with him were heavy with sleep; but then having awaken thoroughly, they saw
his glory and the two men standing with him.
   9:33
         And it happened, while* they were separating from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master*, it is good
for us to be here, and we should make* three tabernacles: one for you and one for Moses and one for
Elijah; (not knowing exactly what he is saying).
    9:34
         Now while he himself is saying these things, a cloud became apparent and overshadowed
them, and they feared this while* those men were entering into the cloud. 9:35 And a voice came* out-
of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear° him. 9:36 And while* the voice was happening,
Jesus was found alone. And they themselves were silent and reported to no one in those days,
anything of the things which they have seen.
   {Mar 9:14-29 & Mat 17:14-21 & Luk 9:37-43 Region of Caesarea Philippi.}
    9:37
         Now it happened, on the next day, they themselves went down from the mountain, a large
crowd met him. 9:38 And behold, a man from the crowd cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech of you to
look upon my son, because he is my only begotten son. 9:39 And behold, a spirit takes him and he
suddenly cries out, and it convulses him with foaming from the mouth, and it departs from him with
difficulty, bruising him. 9:40 And I had besought of your disciples in-order-that they might cast it
forth, and they were not able.
    9:41
         And, Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, until when will I be
with you° and tolerate you°? Lead your son here. 9:42 But while coming near, still the demon ripped
at him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy and gave him
back to his father.
   {Mar 9:30-32 & Mat 17:22-23 & Luk 9:43-45 Return to Galilee.}
   9:43
         Now they were all being astounded at the majesty of God.
    But while all were marveling upon all the things which Jesus did*, he said to his disciples, 9:44
You°, place° these words into your° ears; for* the Son of Man is about to be given up into the hands
of men. 9:45 But they were not considering this declaration, and it was hiding from them in-order-that
they might not sense it, and they were afraid to ask him concerning this declaration.
   {Mar 9:33-50 & Mat 18:1-14 & Luk 9:46-50 Sept., 29 AD.}
    9:46
         Now a reasoning entered in among them, which of them would be the greater. 9:47 But after
Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he grabbed a young child and stood him beside himself, 9:48
and said to them, Whoever accepts this young child in my name accepts me, and whoever accepts

    9:49
         But John answered and said, Master*, we saw someone casting forth demons in your name,
and we forbade him, because he is not following after us. 9:50 And Jesus said to him, Do° not forbid
him; for* he who is not against us, is fighting on our behalf.

         Now it happened, while* the days were being fulfilled of his taking up, and he established his
face to travel to Jerusalem, 9:52 and sent messengers before his face, and traveling away, they entered
into a village of the Samaritans, so-as to prepare for him. 9:53 And they did not accept him, because
his face was established to be traveling to Jerusalem.
    9:54
         Now after his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, do you will that we should
tell fire to descend from heaven and consume them as Elijah also did*?
    9:55
         But he turned and rebuked them, and said, You° do not know of what spirit you° are. 9:56 For*
the Son of man came, not to destroy the lives of men, but to save them.
    {Luk 9:56b-62; no parallel. Similar: Mat 8:20-22}
    And they traveled to a different village. 9:57 Now it happened while they themselves are traveling
on the road, a certain one said to him, I will be following you wherever you go, Lord.
    9:58
         And Jesus said to him, The foxes have burrows and the birds of the heaven have nests, but the
Son of Man has nowhere that he may bow his head.
    9:59
         But he said to a different one, Follow me.
    But he said, Lord, permit* me first to bury my father after I have gone there.
    9:60
         But Jesus said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you while you have gone
away, thoroughly proclaim the kingdom of God.
    9:61
         But a different one also said, I will be following you, Lord, but permit* me first to bid farewell
to the ones who are in my house.
    9:62
         But Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand upon the plow and looking behind, is fit

  for the kingdom of God.

two by two} into every city and place before his face, where he himself was about to go. 10:2 Therefore,

you°, It will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.

Tyre and Sidon, the ones having happened in you°, they would have repented long-ago, sitting in
sackcloth and ashes. 10:14 However it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than
for you°. 10:15 And you, Capernaum, who was exalted to heaven. You will be descending to Hades.

           Jesus was glad in the spirit in that same hour, and said, I profess you, Father, Lord of the
heaven and the earth, because you hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them
to infants. Yes Father, because thus it became a delight before you.
     10:22
           And having turned to the disciples, he said, All things were given to me by my Father, and
no one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son and he to
whomever the Son wills to reveal him.

having practiced what, will I be inheriting everlasting life?

           But Jesus, having taken it in, said, A certain man was going-down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and laid wounds on him. They went away, and
left him, being half dead.
     10:31
           But a certain priest was going-down on that road according-to {i.e., by} coincidence, and
having seen him, he evaded him. 10:32 Now likewise, a Levite also happened to be in the place, when
he came and saw him, he evaded him too.

       And having gone to him, he bound up his various traumas, pouring upon them oil and wine. And
having mounted him upon his own animal, he led him to an inn and cared for him. 10:35 And upon the
next-day, after he went forth, having put out two denarii, he gave them to the innkeeper and said,
Care for him, and anything whatever you spend over that, I will be repaying you, in the time for me
to come back through again. 10:36 Therefore, who of these three seems to you to have become a
neighbor to the one who fell among the robbers?

            Now he said, He who practiced an act of mercy with him.

woman, Martha by name, accepted him into her house. 10:39 And she was a sister to her, the one called
Mary, who also sat beside the feet of Jesus and was hearing his word. 10:40 But Martha was being
distracted concerning much service for them, and having stood up, she said, Lord, do you not care
that my sister was leaving me to serve alone? Therefore, speak to her in-order-that she may jointly
help me.
      10:41
             But Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and disturbed
concerning many things, 10:42 but there is need of one thing, and Mary has chosen for herself the good
part, which will not be taken away from her.

from a journey, and I have nothing as to what I will be placing beside him. 11:7 And he having
answered from inside, might say, Do not be harassing me. The door has already been locked and my
children are in the bunk with me. I am not able to give to you bread, even if I had stood up. 11:8 I say

needs.

you° should say, 12:12 for* the Holy Spirit will teach you° in that same hour what it is essential for you°
to say.
    12:13
           Now someone out-of the crowd said to him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance
with me.
     12:14
            But he said to him, Man, who designated me a justice or a divider over you°?
    12:15
           Now he said to them, See° and guard° yourselves from greed, because not to anyone is his life
in the greed to abound from his possessions.
     12:16
            Now he spoke a parable to them, saying: The farmland of a certain rich man was fertile; 12:17
and he was reasoning in himself, saying, What should I do*, because I have nowhere, in which, I will
gather together my fruits? 12:18 And he said, I will be doing* this: I will be taking down my barns and
build greater ones. And I will be gathering together there, all my fruits* of labor and my good things.
12:19
      And I will be saying to my soul, Soul, you have many good things laying up *for many years; rest
yourself, eat, drink, and be joyous.
     12:20
            But God said to him, Fool, they asked back your soul from you in this night, and the things
which you prepared, to whom will it all be going? 12:21 So is the one storing up treasure for himself,
and is not being rich toward God.

    12:22
           Now he said to his disciples, Because of this, I am saying to you°, Do° not be anxious for your°
life, what you° might eat; not even what you° might clothe your° body with. 12:23 The life you° have
is more-than the nourishment, and the body is more-than the clothing. 12:24 Consider° the ravens, that
they do not sow nor reap for which there is no storeroom nor a barn, and God nourishes them. How-
much do you° rather carry more-value-than the birds! 12:25 But who out-of you°, by being anxious, is
able to add one cubit upon his stature? 12:26 Therefore, if you° are not able to add a little thing, why
are you° anxious concerning the rest? 12:27 Consider° the lilies, somehow they are growing. They are
not laboring nor are they spinning; but I say to you°, Even Solomon in all his glory, was not dressed
like one of these. 12:28 But if God so dresses-up the grass in the field, which today is here and the
next-day is cast into the oven; how-much more will he clothe you°, the small faith ones? 12:29 And do°
not seek what you° might eat or what you° might drink, and do° not be in anxious suspense. 12:30 For*
the nations of the world are seeking after all these things, but your° Father knows that you° have
needs of these things. 12:31 However, seek° the kingdom of God and all these things will be added to
you°.
    12:32
           Do not fear, little flock, because your° Father was delighted to give you° the kingdom. 12:33
Sell° your° possessions and give° as charity; make*° for yourselves money-bags which do not become-
obsolete, an unfailing treasure in the heavens, where no thief draws near, nor moth corrupts. 12:34 For*
where your° treasure is, your° heart will be there also.
    12:35
           Let° your° loins be girded, and the lamps burning; 12:36 and you° are similar to men waiting for
their lord, as to when he might vacate from the marriage-festivities; in-order-that after he came and
knocked, they may immediately open to him. 12:37 The fortunate bondservants are those whom the
lord will find watching, after he has come to them. Assuredly I am saying to you°, that he will gird
himself, and will recline them at the meal {i.e., seat them}, and having passed-beside them, he will be
serving them. 12:38 And if he comes in the second watch, and in the third, and should find them so,
those are fortunate bondservants.
    12:39
           But know° this, that if the householder knew in what hour the thief is coming, he would have
watched, and not have allowed his house roof to be burrowed through. 12:40 You° therefore, also
become° prepared, because in what hour that you° do not think the Son of Man is coming, he comes.
    12:41
           Now Peter said to him, Lord, are you saying this parable to us, or even to all?
     12:42
           But the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom the lord will be
designating over his bondservants, the one to give them their food-allowance in season? 12:43 That
fortunate bondservant, whom his lord will find so doing* after he has come. 12:44 Truly I say to you°,
that he will be designating him over all his possessions. 12:45 But if that bondservant says in his heart,
my lord delays to come, and may begin to beat the young-servants and the maidservants, and to eat
and drink, and to be drunken; 12:46 the lord of that bondservant will be coming in a day in which he
is not expecting, and in an hour in which he does not know, and will be flogging him and will be
placing his part with the unbelieving.
    12:47
           But that bondservant, who knew his lord’s will and did not prepare, nor did* pertaining to his
will, will be whipped with many lashes; 12:48 but he who did not know and did* things worthy of
lashes, will be whipped with few lashes. But to everyone in which much was given, much will be
required from him, and to whom were consigned much, they will be asking even-more from him.

immersion* to be immersed* in, and how I am very troubled until which time it should be completed!

       You° are thinking that I came* to give peace in the earth? I tell you°, No, but rather division. 12:52
      *
For there will be from hereafter five in one house having been divided, three against two, and two
against three. 12:53 Father will be divided against son, and son against father; mother against daughter,

wind is blowing, you° say, There will be a burning heat, and it happens. 12:56 You° hypocrites, you°

decipher} this time? 12:57 But why are you° not judging the righteous things, even from among
yourselves? 12:58 For* as you are proceeding-away on the road with your opponent to be in front of
the ruler, give work {i.e., work hard} to have yourself set-free from him; lest he might drag you down
to the judge and the judge might give you to the constable and the constable might cast you into
prison. 12:59 I say to you, you might never come forth from there, until which time you should repay
even the last bronze-coin.

Pilate mixed with their sacrifices. 13:2 And Jesus answered and said to them, Do you° think that these
Galileans became sinners more than all the other Galileans, because they have suffered such things?
13:3
       I am saying to you°, No, but, if you° do not repent, you° will all likewise* perish. 13:4 Or those
eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you° think that these became

          Now he spoke this parable: A certain one had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came
seeking fruit in it and found nothing. 13:7 Now he said to the vine-dresser, Behold three years, I come
seeking fruit and find nothing in this fig tree. Cut it off. Why does it also do-away-with the good
soil?
     13:8
          But he answered and says to him, Lord, Also leave it for this year, until which time, I should
dig around it and put in more manures; 13:9 and if it indeed produces fruit, good; otherwise you will
be cutting it off in the future.

a woman having a spirit of sickness for eighteen years, and she was always stooped over and was
not able to completely stand-erect. 13:12 Now having seen her, Jesus summoned her and said to her,
Woman, you have been released from your sickness. 13:13 And he laid his hands upon her and
instantly she was straightened and was glorifying God.

          Now the ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath,
answered and said to the crowd, There are six days in which it is essential for men to work;
therefore, be° healed, coming in these days, and not on the day of the Sabbath.
    13:15
          Therefore, the Lord answered him and said, O hypocrites, do not each of you° on the Sabbath
loose his bull or his donkey from the manger and having led him away, deliver to it a drink? 13:16
Now this one, being a daughter of Abraham, behold, whom the Adversary bound for eighteen years,
is it not essential for her to be loosed from this bond on the day of the Sabbath?

It is similar to a kernel of a mustard-seed, which a man took and cast into his garden, and it grew and
became a great tree, and the birds of the heaven nested in its branches.
    13:20

then?

you°, Many will be seeking to enter in and will not be strong-enough. 13:25 From which time the
householder would have arose and locked the door and you°, being outside, might begin to stand and
to knock on the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
    And having answered, he will say to you°, I do not know you° or where you° are from.

          And he will say, I say to you°, I do not know you° or where you° are from. Withdraw° from
me, all the workers of unrighteousness. 13:28 The weeping and the gnashing of teeth will be there,
whenever you° see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and
you° being cast forth outside. 13:29 And they will be coming from the east and west and north and

perform healings today and the next-day and I am completed in the third day. 13:33 However it is
essential to me to travel on today and the next-day and in the next day, because it is not acceptable

           And it happened, while* he was going into a house of a certain one of the rulers of the
Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they themselves were observing him. 14:2 And behold, there
was before him, a certain man with dropsy. 14:3 And Jesus answered and spoke to the professors of
the law and Pharisees, saying, If it is not legal to heal on the Sabbath, then? 14:4 But they were quiet.
And he grabbed him and healed and dismissed him. 14:5 And he answered and said to them, Of which
one of you° will a son or a bull fall into a well, and he will not be immediately pulling him up on the
Sabbath day? 14:6 And they were not strong-enough to answer back to him as to these things.
    14:7
          Now he spoke a parable to the ones who have been invited, while taking-heed how they were
choosing for themselves the foremost-places; saying to them: 14:8 Whenever you might be invited by
anyone to a marriage-festivities, do not recline in the foremost-place; because maybe a more admired
one than you may be invited by him, 14:9 and the one who invited you and him, when he has come,
will say to you, Give this one your place, and then you may begin with shame to hold the last place.
14:10
      But whenever you might be invited, after traveling there, lean-back in the last place; in-order-
that whenever he who has invited you comes, he might say to you, Friend, advance upward, and then
it will be glory in the sight of the ones who recline at the table together-with you. 14:11 Because
everyone who is exalting himself will be humbled, and the one humbling himself will be exalted.
    14:12
           Now he was also saying to the one who invited him, Whenever you make* a meal or a supper,
do not summon your friends, nor your brethren, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors; lest they
themselves may also invite you too and it might become a repayment for you. 14:13 But whenever you
make* a banquet, invite the poor, the disabled, the lame, the blind; 14:14 and you will be fortunate,
because they do not have anything in which to repay you; for* you will be repaid in the resurrection
of the righteous.

           But he said to him, A certain man made* a great supper, and he invited many; 14:17 and he sent
forth his bondservant in the hour of the supper to say to the ones who have been invited, Come°,
because all things are already prepared. 14:18 And they all, from one desire, began to excuse
themselves. The first said to him, I bought a field, and I have a necessity to go forth and to see it. I
request of you, have me excused!

them, Rejoice° together-with me, because I found my sheep, the one which had lost its way. 15:7 I say
to you° thus, that there will be joy in heaven over one repenting sinner, more than over ninety-nine
righteous ones, who have no need of repentance.

a lamp and sweep the house, and seek carefully until which time she should find it? 15:9 And having
found it, she calls together the friends and the neighbors, she has, saying, Rejoice° together-with me,
because I found the two-denarii-coin which I lost. 15:10 So, I say to you°, It becomes joy in the sight

Father, give to me the part of the estate that would be put toward me. And he sectioned off his
livelihood to them. 15:13 And not many days after, the younger son gathered it all together and went-
abroad into a far region, and he squandered his estate with riotous living there. 15:14 Now having
spent all, a mighty famine happened throughout that region, and he himself began to come-short of
money. 15:15 And traveling away, he joined himself to one of the citizens of that region, and he sent
him into his fields to feed swine. 15:16 And he was desiring to fill his belly from the carob pods of
which the swine were eating, and no one was giving anything to him. 15:17 Now after he came to
himself, he said, How-many of my father’s hired servants are abounding, even of bread? But I am
perishing here in famine! 15:18 When I have risen* up, I will be traveling to my father, and will say to
him, Father, I sinned at heaven, and in your sight. 15:19 And I am no more worthy to be called your
son. Make* me like one of your hired servants. 15:20 And having stood up, he came to his father.
    But while being still distant, far from him, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and
fell upon his neck and kissed him. 15:21 But the son said to him, Father, I sinned at heaven, and in your
sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
    15:22
           But the father said to his bondservants, Bring° out the foremost robe and clothe° him, and
give him a ring *for his hand and shoes *for the feet; 15:23 and after you° have brought the fattened
      °
calf, sacrifice° it, and after we have eaten it, we should be joyous. 15:24 Because this one, my son, was
dead and then lived again, and lost and then was found. And they began to be joyous. 15:25 Now his
elder son was in the field and as while coming, he drew near to the house, and he heard harmony and
dancers. 15:26 And having called one of the young-servants, he was inquiring what these things might
be.
    15:27
           But he said to him, Your brother is coming, and your father sacrificed the fattened calf
because he has received him back healthy. 15:28 But he was made angry and was not willing to enter
and therefore, his father went forth and was pleading him.
    15:29
           But he answered and said to his father, Behold, I did serve* you for so-many years, and I
never transgressed a commandment from you, and yet you never gave me a young-goat in-order-that
I might be joyous with my friends. 15:30 But when this one, your son came, who devoured your
livelihood with prostitutes, you sacrificed the fattened calf for him.

one was indicted by him as one squandering his possessions. 16:2 And having summoned him, he said
to him, What is this thing which I am hearing concerning you? Give me the account of your
stewardship; for* you will not still be able to be a steward.

stewardship from me? I am not strong-enough to dig; I am ashamed to beg. 16:4 I have known what
I should be doing*, in-order-that whenever I should be removed from the stewardship, they may
accept me into their houses. 16:5 And having called to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to
the first, How-much do you owe to my lord?
    16:6
         Now he said, A hundred eight-gallon-containers of oil.

    And he said to him, Accept your writing {i.e., contract} and after you have sat down, quickly write
fifty.
     16:7
          Thereafter, he said to a different one, and how-much do you owe?
     Now he said, A hundred twelve-bushel-containers of grain.
     And he says to him, Accept your writing {i.e., contract} and write eighty.
     16:8
          And his lord praised the steward of unrighteousness because he did* prudently, because the
sons of this world are more prudent to their own generation; even beyond the sons of the light.
    16:9
          And I say to you°, Make*° friends for yourselves out-of the money of unrighteousness; in-order-
that, whenever you° fail, they may accept you° into the everlasting tabernacles. 16:10 The faithful in
the least matters is also faithful in much, and the unrighteous in the least matters is also unrighteous
in much. 16:11 Therefore, if you° did not become faithful in the unrighteous money, who will be
entrusting the true* riches to you°? 16:12 And if you° did not become faithful in what is another’s, who
will be giving you° what is yours°? 16:13 No domestic servant is able to serve* two lords; for* either
he will hate the one and will love* the other; or he will hold to one and despise the other. You° are
not able to serve* God and money.
    16:14
           Now the Pharisees, who are* money-lovers, were also hearing all these things, and they were
ridiculing him. 16:15 And he said to them, You° are the ones making yourselves righteous in the sight
of men, but God knows your° hearts, because the thing exalted among men is an abomination in
God’s sight.
     16:16
           The law and the prophets were until John; from then the good-news of the kingdom of God
is proclaimed, and everyone violently-enters into it. 16:17 But it is easier for the heaven and the earth
to pass-away, than for one serif of the law to fall short. 16:18 Everyone who divorces his wife and
marries a different one is committing adultery, and everyone who marries the one who has been
divorced from a husband, is committing adultery. {Mat 5:32, 19:9}
    16:19
           Now there was a certain rich man and he was clothing himself in purple and fine-linen, being
radiantly joyous daily. 16:20 Now there was a certain poor man, Lazarus by name, who had been put
before his gate, having been full of sores, 16:21 and desiring to be fully-fed from the falling crumbs
of the rich man’s table. But even the dogs, coming to him, were licking his sores.
    16:22
           Now it happened for the poor man to die and for him to be carried away by the messengers
into Abraham’s bosom, and the rich man also died and was buried. 16:23 And having lifted up his eyes
in Hades, being* in torments, he sees Abraham from afar, and Lazarus at his bosoms.
     16:24
           Who, having shouted, he said, Father Abraham, show-mercy to me, and send Lazarus in-
order-that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and may cool my tongue, because I am in anguish
in this flame.
     16:25
           But Abraham said, Child, remember that you received your good things in your life and
Lazarus likewise evil things, but now he is comforted here and you are in anguish. 16:26 And over all
these things, a great chasm has been established between us and you°, *that the ones who wish to
cross over from here to you° may not be able, nor may they ferry over from there to us. 16:27 But he
said, Therefore, father, I am requesting him in-order-that you should send him to my father’s house;
16:28
      for* I have five brethren; *that he may thoroughly testify to them in-order-that they themselves
may not even come into this place of torment.

           But he said, No, father Abraham, but if someone travels to them from the dead, they will be
repenting.

if someone rises* up from the dead.

          Now he said to the disciples, It is not inevitable: offenses are to come, but woe to him,
through whom they come! 17:2 It is beneficial for him if a millstone rotated by a donkey encompassed
around his neck, and he has been tossed into the sea, rather than that* he should offend one of these
little ones.
    17:3
          Take-heed° to yourselves; and if your brother sins at {i.e., against} you, rebuke him, and if he
repents, forgive him. 17:4 And if he sins at {i.e., against} you seven-times in the day, and should return
seven-times in the day, saying, I repent. You will be forgiving him.
    17:5
          And the apostles said to the Lord, Add more faith to us.
    17:6
          Now the Lord said, If you° have faith like a kernel of a mustard-seed, you° would have spoken
to this mulberry fig tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed* you°. 17:7
But who out-of you°, having a bondservant plowing or shepherding, will immediately say to him,
after he entered in from the field, After he has passed-beside you, lean-back at the table. 17:8 But will
he not rather say to him, Prepare what I may dine on. And having girded yourself, serve me, until
I eat and drink and you may eat and may drink after these things. 17:9 He does not have gratitude to
that bondservant because he did* the things which were commanded him, does he? I think not. 17:10
So also you°, whenever you° do* all the things which were commanded to you°, say°, We are useless
bondservants, because we have done* what we ought to do.

    17:11
           And it happened, while* he himself was traveling to Jerusalem, even he himself was going
through the middle of Samaria and Galilee. 17:12 And while entering into a certain village, ten men
who are lepers encountered him there, who stood farther out; 17:13 and they themselves lifted up their
voice, saying, Jesus, Master*, show-mercy on us.
    17:14
          And having seen them, he said to them, After traveling back, show° yourselves to the priests.
    And it happened, while* they were proceeding-away, they were cleansed. 17:15 Now one out-of
them, having seen that he was healed, returned with a loud voice, glorifying God; 17:16 and he fell
upon his face beside his feet, giving-thanks to him, and he was a Samaritan.
    17:17
           But Jesus answered and said, Were not the ten cleansed, but where are the nine? 17:18 Were
not any found, except this immigrant, who returned to give glory to God? 17:19 And he said to him,
After you have stood up, travel on. Your faith has cured you.
    17:20
           And having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God is coming, he answered
them and said, The kingdom of God is not coming with observation; 17:21 nor will they say, Behold,
here! Or, behold there! For* behold, the kingdom of God is within you°.

the days of the Son of Man, and you° will not see it. 17:23 And they will say to you°, Behold here! Or
behold there! Do° not go away, nor pursue them. 17:24 For* just-like the lightning, the one flashing
from the one end under heaven, and shines to the other end under heaven; so will the Son of Man
be in his day. 17:25 But first it is essential for him to suffer many things and to be rejected* away from
this generation. 17:26 And just-as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will also be in the days of the
Son of Man. 17:27 They were eating; they were drinking; they were marrying; they were being
betrothed, till which day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
17:28
        Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot; they were eating; they were drinking; they
were buying; they were selling; they were planting; they were building; 17:29 but in the day which Lot
went forth from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. 17:30
According-to these things, it will be in the day which the Son of Man is revealed. 17:31 He who will
be upon the housetop in that day, and has his goods in the house, let him not go-down to take them
up, and the one who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn behind for them. 17:32 Remember° Lot’s
wife. {Gen 19:26} 17:33 Whoever should seek to save his life will be losing it, and whoever loses it will
be preserving it. 17:34 I say to you°, There will be two upon one bed in this night; the one will be taken
and the other one will be left. 17:35 Two will be grinding at the same place; the one will be taken and
the other one will be left. 17:36 {T} There will be two in the field; the one will be taken and the other
one will be left.

            And they answered and say to him, Where, Lord?
     Now he said to them, Where the body is, the vultures will also be gathered together there.

     18:1
            Now he also spoke a parable to them, *that* it is essential to always pray, and not to be
depressed; 18:2 saying: A certain judge was in a certain city, who was not fearing God and not revering
man. 18:3 Now a widow was in that city, and she was coming often to him, saying, Avenge me from
my opponent. 18:4 And he did not wish to at that time, but after these things continued, he said in
himself, Even if I do not fear God, and I do not revere man; 18:5 yet because this widow is harassing
me, I will avenge her, in-order-that she may not pester me, coming often *for an end of her opponent.
    18:6
          But the Lord said, Hear° with understanding what the judge of the unrighteousness says about
himself.
     18:7
           Now, should God not do* the avenging of his chosen the ones crying to him day and night?
Also, should he not have patience upon them?
     18:8
           I say to you°, that he will be doing* the avenging on them quickly.
     However, when the Son of Man has come, will he then be finding the faith upon the earth?
      18:9
            Now he spoke this parable to some who have confidence in themselves, that they are
righteous, and scorning the rest: 18:10 Two men went-up into the temple to pray; the first one a
Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 18:11 The Pharisee stood with {i.e., by} himself, and was praying
these things, God, I give-thanks to you, that I am not like the rest of men: ravening, unrighteous ones,
adulterers or even just-like this tax collector. 18:12 I fast twice in the week; I tithe of all things, as
many things as I procure. 18:13 And the tax collector, standing from afar, was not even willing to lift
up the eyes to heaven, but was beating at his chest, saying, God, be lenient to me, the sinner. 18:14 I

           Now they were also bringing to him their babies in-order-that he might touch them, but after
the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 18:16 But Jesus, having called them to him, said, Allow° the
young children to come to me and do° not forbid them; for* the kingdom of God is of such. 18:17
Assuredly I am saying to you°, Whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a young child, he
should never enter into it.

           And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, by having practiced what, will I inherit
everlasting life?

            But Jesus said to him, Why do you call* me good? None is good, except one, our God. 18:20
You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery. Do not murder. Do not steal. Do not falsely
testify. Honor your father and your mother.’ {Exo 20:12-16 & Deu 5:16-20.}

            But he said, I have observed all these things from my youth up.

            Now having heard these things, Jesus said to him, One thing is still deficient for you. Sell
all things, as many things as you have and distribute to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven
and come-here. Follow me. 18:23 But he heard these things, and became very sorrowful; for* he was
extremely rich. 18:24 Now having seen him, Jesus became very sorrowful, he said, How the ones who
have wealth will hardly enter into the kingdom of God! 18:25 For* it is easier for a camel to enter in
through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

            Now the ones who heard it said, And who is able to be saved?

           Now while they themselves are hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because
of the area itself is near to Jerusalem, and because they think that the kingdom of God is about to
be instantly manifested. 19:12 Therefore, he said: A certain noble man, traveled into a far away region,
to receive a kingdom for himself and to return. 19:13 Now he called ten of his bondservants, and gave
them ten two-hundred denarii-coins, and said to them, Trade° with this until I come. 19:14 But his

said, These bondservants to whom he gave the silver, are to be summoned to him in-order-that he

           Now the first came*, saying, Lord, your two-hundred denarii-coins has been worked up to ten
two-hundred denarii-coins more. 19:17 And he said to him, Well done, good bondservant, because you
became faithful in the least matters. You have ten cities. Be the authority over them.

           And the second came, saying, Your two-hundred denarii-coins, Lord, made* five two-hundred
denarii-coins. 19:19 But he also said to this one, You, become the authority over five cities.

coins, which I was holding, laying it up in a handkerchief; 19:21 for* I was fearing you, because you

           But he says to him, I will be judging you out-of your own mouth, you evil bondservant. You
knew that I am an austere man, lifting up from what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not
sow? 19:23 And why did you not give my silver over to the bank, and after I came back, I would have
appropriated it together-with interest?

called Olives, he sent two of his disciples, 19:30 and said, Proceed° into the village in front of me; in

mankind has sat at anytime. Having loosed it, lead° it here. 19:31 And if anyone asks you°, Why are

           And having entered into the temple, he began to cast forth the ones selling and buying in it,

      saying to them, It has been written, ‘My house is a house of prayer, but you° made* it a den of

robbers.’ {Isa 56:7 & Jer 7:11} 19:47 Now he was teaching daily in the temple. But the high-priests and
the scribes and the foremost ones of the people were seeking to destroy him. 19:48 And they were not
finding what they might do*; for* the people were all hanging on him, listening.

     20:1
          And it happened on one of those days, while he himself is teaching the people in the temple
and proclaiming the good-news, the priests and the scribes, together-with the elders stood by; 20:2 and
they spoke to him, saying, Tell us, by what authority are you doing* these things? Or who is he who
gave you this authority?
     20:3
           But he answered and said to them, I will also ask you° one question, and tell° me. 20:4 The
immersion* of John, was it from heaven or from men?
     20:5
          Now they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, From heaven; he will say, Why
did you° not believe him? 20:6 But if we should say, From men; all the people will be stoning us; for*
they have confidence that John is a prophet. 20:7 And they answered claiming not to know from
where.
     20:8
           And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you° by what authority I am doing* these things.
     {Mar 12:1-12 & Mat 21:33-46 & Luk 20:9-19.}
     20:9
          Now he began to speak to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard and rented it out
to farmers, and went-abroad for considerable times {i.e., a long time}. 20:10 And he sent out a
bondservant in the harvest season to the farmers in-order-that they might give to him from the fruit
of the vineyard, but the farmers whipped him and sent him away empty handed. 20:11 And he added
a different bondservant to send, and they also whipped and dishonored him, and sent him out empty.
20:12
      And he added a third to send, and they also traumatized this one and cast him forth.
    20:13
           But the lord of the vineyard said, What should I do*? I will be sending my beloved son;
perchance when they have seen this one, they will revere him. 20:14 But after the farmers saw him,
they were reasoning with themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come-here°. We should kill him in-
order-that the inheritance may become ours. 20:15 And having cast him forth, outside the vineyard,
they killed him. Therefore, what will the lord of the vineyard do* to them? 20:16 He will be coming
and will be destroying these farmers, and will be giving the vineyard to others.
     But having heard this, they said, Let it not happen!
     20:17
           But he looked at them and said, Therefore, what is this which has been written, ‘The stone
which the builders rejected*, this one became the head of the corner’? {Psa 118:22} 20:18 Everyone who
has fallen upon that stone will be shattered, but upon whomever it falls, it will be smashing him.
     20:19
           And the high-priests and the scribes sought to put hands upon him in the same hour and yet
they feared the people; for* they knew that he spoke this parable to them.

     20:20
           And having observed him, they sent forth agents, who themselves pretend to be righteous in-
order-that they might grab him from his speech, *that* they might give him to the rule and the
authority of the governor. 20:21 And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that you say and teach
correctly, and you do not receive the countenance of men, but in truth, are teaching the way of God.

      Is it legal for us to give tax to Caesar or not?

           But he perceived their craftiness and said to them, Why are you° testing me? 20:24 Show° me
a denarius. Whose image and inscription has it?
     But they answered and said, Caesar’s.
    20:25
           But he said to them, Now-then, give° to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and to God the
things which are God’s. 20:26 And they were not strong-enough to grasp his declaration in front of the
people, and they marveled at his answer and were silent.

           Now some of the Sadducees came near, the ones who contradict, saying no resurrection is to
be; they asked him, 20:28 saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, in-order-that if anyone’s brother dies,
having a wife, and this one should die childless, his brother should take the wife and should raise*
up seed to his brother. {Deu 25:5} 20:29 Therefore, seven brothers were with us, and the first took a wife
and died childless; 20:30 and the second took the woman and this one died childless; 20:31 and likewise*
the third took her, and likewise* the seven also left no children and they all died. 20:32 But after all
things, the woman also died. 20:33 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of them does she
become? For* the seven had her as wife.
     20:34
           And Jesus answered and said to them, The sons of this world marry and are betrothed. 20:35
But the ones who were deemed worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead,
neither marry, nor are they betrothed, 20:36 for* neither are they able to die anymore; for* they are equal
to the messengers, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. 20:37 But that the dead are
raised, even Moses divulged at the bush, as he calls* the Lord, the God of Abraham and the God of
Isaac and the God of Jacob. {Exo 3:6} 20:38 Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for*
all live to him.
     20:39
           But some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, you said well.
     {Mar 12:28-34 & Mat 22:34-40 & Luk 20:40.}

           But they were not daring anymore to ask him anything.

           Now he said to them, How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son? 20:42 And David
himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, 20:43 until I
should place your enemies as the footstool of your feet. {Psa 110:1} 20:44 Therefore, David calls him
Lord, and so how is he his son?

           But while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples, 20:46 Take-heed°, stay away
from the scribes, who wish to walk in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces and
foremost seats in the synagogues and foremost-places in the suppers; 20:47 who are devouring widows’
houses, and are praying long prayers for a pretext. These will be receiving even-more condemnation.

        And while some are speaking concerning the temple, that it has been adorned with beautiful
stones and votive-offerings, he said, 21:6 As for these things which you° are viewing, the days will be
coming in which a stone will not be left here upon another stone, which will not be torn-down.
   21:7
        Now they asked him, saying, Therefore, teacher, when will these things be? And what is the
sign whenever these things are about to happen?
   21:8
        And he said, Beware°, do° not be misled; for* many will be coming in my name, saying, I am
he, and, The time has drawn near. You° therefore, do° not travel after them. 21:9 But whenever you°
hear of wars and unrests, do° not be terrified; for* it is essential for these things to happen first, but
the end is not immediately here.
   21:10
          Then he said to them, Nation will be raised against nation and kingdom against kingdom; 21:11
and there will be great earthquakes in different places and famines and plagues. There will be both
terrors and great signs from heaven. 21:12 But before all these things, they will be putting their hands
upon you° and will be persecuting you°, giving you° up to the synagogues and prisons, while being
led in front of kings and governors because of my name. 21:13 But it will be transpiring into a
testimony for you°. 21:14 Therefore, place° it into your° hearts, not to meditate beforehand on how to
make a defense. 21:15 For* I will be giving you° a mouth and wisdom, which all who lay in opposition
to you° will not be able to stand against, nor to speak against. 21:16 But you° will be given up even by
parents and relatives and friends, and brethren, and they will be slaying some out-of you°. 21:17 And
you° will be hated by everyone because of my name. 21:18 And a hair out-of your° head should never

ones who have authority over them are called benefactors. 22:26 But not so with you°, but the greater

stone’s throw, and having placed himself on his knees, he was praying, 22:42 saying, Father, if you are
willing to carry this cup away from me, however not my will, but let yours happen. 22:43 Now a

          But he denied him, saying, Woman, I do not know him. 22:58 And after a little bit, a different
one saw him, and was saying, You also are one out-of them.
    But Peter said, Man, I am not.
    22:59
          And after approximately a one hour interval, then a certain other was stoutly affirming,
saying, This one was also with him in truth; for* he is a Galilean.
    22:60
          But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. And instantly, while he himself is

still speaking, the rooster crowed. 22:61 And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter was
reminded of the word of the Lord, how that he said to him, Before the rooster is to crow, you will
be denying me three-times. 22:62 And having gone outside, Peter wept bitterly.
    {Mar 14:55-65 & Mat 26:59-68 & Luk 22:63-65.}
    22:63
          And the men holding Jesus were mocking him, whipping him. 22:64 And having covered him,
they were beating his face, and were asking him, saying, Prophesy. Who is it who struck you? 22:65
And they were saying many other things to him, blaspheming.
    {Mar 15:1 & Mat 27:1-2 Luk 22:66-23:1 Joh 18:28a Jerusalem early Fri. morning.}
    22:66
          And as it became day, the eldership of the people were gathered together, both high-priests
and scribes, and they led him up into their council, saying, 22:67 If you are the Christ, tell us.
    But he said to them, If I tell you°, you° should never believe; 22:68 and if I should also ask, you°
should never answer me or should ever release me. 22:69 From hereafter, the Son of Man will be seated
at the right hand of the power of God.
    22:70
          Now they all said, Therefore, are you the Son of God?
    But he said to them, You° are saying that I am.
    22:71
          Now they said, Why do we still have need of testimony? For* we ourselves heard this from
his own mouth.

    23:1
          And all the multitude of them, having stood up, led him in front of Pilate.
    {Mar 15:2-5 & Mat 27:11-14 & Luk 23:2-5 & Joh 18:28b-38 Jerusalem early Fri. morning.}
    23:2
         Now they began to accuse him, saying, We found this one perverting the nation and forbidding
to give taxes to Caesar, and saying himself to be a Christ, a king.
    23:3
          But Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews?
    Now he answered and said to him, You say correctly.
    23:4
          Now Pilate said to the high-priests and the crowds, I am finding no crime in this man.
    23:5
          But they were insisting, saying, He is shaking up the people, teaching throughout the whole
of Judea, having begun from Galilee, insofar as here.
    {Luk 23:6-12 Jerusalem early Fri. morning; no parallel.}
    23:6
          But after Pilate heard Galilee, he asked if the man is a Galilean. 23:7 And after having fully
known that he is from Herod’s authority, he sent him back to Herod, who himself was also in
Jerusalem in these days.
    23:8
          Now having seen Jesus, Herod rejoiced exceedingly; for* he was wishing to see him from a
considerable time, because he was hoping to see some sign happening by him, and to hear many
things concerning him. 23:9 Now he was asking him questions with* considerable words, but he
answered him nothing.
    23:10
          Now the high-priests and the scribes stood, intensely accusing him.
    23:11
          Now Herod, together-with his soldiers, having scorned and having mocked him, and having
dressed him in bright apparel, sent him back to Pilate.
    23:12
          Now both Pilate and Herod became friends with one another in that same day; for* they were

formerly being in hostility toward themselves.
   23:13
         Now Pilate called together the high-priests and the rulers and the people, 23:14 and said to
them, You° brought this man to me, as one turning away the people to riot, and behold, I examined
him in your° sight, and did not find a crime in this man of which you° accuse against him. 23:15 But
even Herod found nothing. For* he sent him back to you°, and behold, nothing worthy of death has
been done* by him. 23:16 Therefore, after having disciplined him, I will be releasing him. 23:17 But, he
had to release to them one prisoner every Passover feast by necessity.
   23:18
         But they cried out altogether, saying, Take this one and release Barabbas to us. 23:19 He was
one who had been put into prison because of a certain riot, which happened in the city, and for
murder.
   23:20
         Therefore, Pilate shouted to them again, wishing to release Jesus.
   23:21
         But they were shouting out, saying, Crucify him! Crucify him!
   23:22
         Now he said to them the third-time, For* what evil did* this one do? I did not find a crime
worthy of death in him; therefore, after having disciplined him, I will be releasing him. 23:23 But they
were urgently asking with loud voices for him to be crucified. And their voices and those of the high-
priests were prevailing. 23:24 But Pilate decided their request was to happen. 23:25 Now he released the
one having been cast into the prison because of riot and murder, whom they were asking for, but he
gave up Jesus to their will.
   {Mar 15:20-23 & Mat 27:31-34 & Luk 23:26-33 & Joh 19:17 Road to the Cross, Fri. morning.}
   23:26
         And as they led him away, they grabbed someone named Simon from Cyrene, coming from
the rural-area, and they placed the cross upon him to carry it behind Jesus.
   23:27
         Now a large multitude of the people were following him, and women who also were grieving
and mourning for him. 23:28 But Jesus, having turned to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do° not
weep over me, however, weep° over yourselves and over your° children. 23:29 Because behold, the
days are coming in which they will say, The fortunate ones are: barren and the wombs which did not
give-birth and the breasts that did not nurse. 23:30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall°
upon us, and to the hills, Hide° us. 23:31 Because if they are doing* these things in the green tree, what
might happen in the dry?
   23:32
         Now two others, also criminals, were being led together-with him to be assassinated.
   {Mar 15:24-32 & Mat 27:35-44 & Luk 23:33-43 & Joh 19:18-27 9:00 until Noon, Fri.}
   23:33
         And when they came upon the place which is called The Skull, they crucified him and the
criminals there, who was the one at the right and who was the one at the left.
   23:34
         Now Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for* they do not know what they are doing*.
   ‘Now while dividing his garments, they cast a lot.’ {Psa 22:18} 23:35 And the people stood viewing
and the rulers together-with them were also ridiculing him, saying, He saved others; let him save
himself, if this one is the Christ, the chosen of God.
   23:36
         Now the soldiers were also mocking him, coming near and offering him vinegar, 23:37 and
saying, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself. 23:38 Now an inscription was also over him,
having been written in the alphabets of Greek and Latin and Hebrew, This is the King of the Jews.

   23:39
          Now one of the criminals who was hung there, was blaspheming him, saying, If you are the
Christ save yourself and us!
   23:40
          But, the other answered and was rebuking him, saying, Do you not fear even God, because
you are in the same condemnation? 23:41 And we indeed suffer righteously; for* we are receiving
worthy payment of what things we practiced, but this one practiced nothing improper.
   23:42
          And he said, Jesus, remember me Lord, whenever you come in your kingdom.
   23:43
          And Jesus said to him, Assuredly I am saying to you, You will be with me today in Paradise.
   {Mar 15:34 & Mat 27:45 & Luk 23:44 around Noon.}
   23:44
          Now it was approximately the sixth hour and it became darkness upon the whole earth until
the ninth hour {i.e., Noon to 3:00 PM; Amos 8:8-9?}.
   {Mar 15:34-41 & Mat 27:46-56 & Luk 23:45-49 & Joh 19:28-30 around 5:00 PM.}
   23:45
          And the sun was darkened and the curtain of the temple was split-apart in the middle. 23:46 And
Jesus having shouted with a loud voice, said, Father, I will consign my spirit into your hands. And
having said these things, he expired.
    23:47
          Now having seen what happened, the centurion glorified God, saying, This really was a
righteous man. 23:48 And all the crowds who came* together upon this scene, viewing the things which
had happened, were returning, beating their chests.
    23:49
          Now all his acquaintances and the women who followed from Galilee together-with him,
stood from afar, seeing these things.
   {Mar 15:42-47 & Mat 27:57-66 & Luk 23:50-56 & Joh 19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}
   23:50
          And behold, a man, Joseph by name, who is* a counselor, a good and righteous man 23:51 (this
one was not in alliance with their plan and with their practice), a man from Arimathaea, a city of the
Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God. 23:52 This one went to Pilate, and asked
for the body of Jesus. 23:53 And having taken it down, he entwined it in a linen cloth and placed it in
a hewed out tomb, of which no one was yet laid.
    23:54
           And it was the day of the Preparation and the Sabbath was dawning. 23:55 Now having
followed-after, the women, from Galilee, who were coming together to him, saw the tomb and how
his body was placed.
   23:56
         Now they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And on the Sabbath they indeed relaxed
according-to the commandment.

          Now on the first day of the week, from the deep foggy daybreak, they and some others
together-with them came upon the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared. 24:2 Now they
found the stone has been rolled away from the tomb. 24:3 And having entered in, they did not find the
body of the Lord Jesus. 24:4 And it happened, while* they were perplexed concerning this, and behold,
two men stood by them in flashing apparels. 24:5 Now after they themselves became fearful and
bowing their face down toward the earth, then they said to them, Why are you° seeking the living
with the dead? 24:6 He is not here, but was raised. Remember° how he spoke to you°, being still in

Galilee, 24:7 saying that it is essential for the Son of Man to be given up into the hands of sinful men
and to be crucified and to rise* up on the third day? 24:8 And they were reminded of his declarations.
    {Mar 16:9-11 & Mat 28:9-10 & Luk 24:9-11 & Joh 20:11-18.}
    24:9
         And having returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the
       24:10
rest.        Now they were, Mary the Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the rest
of the women together-with them, those who were saying these things to the apostles. 24:11 And their
declarations appeared like nonsense in their sight, and they were disbelieving them. 24:12 But Peter,
having stood up, ran to the tomb, and peered inside and he sees the linen-strips laying alone. And
he went away with himself {i.e., alone}, marveling at what has happened.
    {Mar 16:12-13 & Luk 24:13-35 & 1Co 15:5 Sun. Afternoon.}
    24:13
          And behold, two out-of them were traveling in that same day to a village which has the name
Emmaus, being sixty furlongs distant from Jerusalem. 24:14 And they themselves were conversing
with one another concerning all these things which have befallen them. 24:15 And it happened, while*
they were conversing and debating together, that Jesus himself, having drawn near, was traveling
together-with them. 24:16 But their eyes were being held-fast so as not to recognize him. 24:17 But he
said to them, What words are these which you° are exchanging back and forth with one another,
while walking? and you° are with a gloomy face, why?
    24:18
           But one who has the name Cleopas answered and said to him, Are you sojourning alone in
Jerusalem and did not know of the things which happened in her in these days?
    24:19
           And he said to them, What things?
    But they said to him, The things concerning Jesus of the Nazarenes, who became a prophet, a
mighty man in work and word in front of God and all the people; 24:20 and how the high-priests and
our rulers gave him up to the condemnation of death and crucified him. 24:21 Now we were hoping
that he himself is the one being about to redeem Israel. But yet today, together-with all these things,
is bringing* us this third day from which these things happened. 24:22 But some women from among
us also astonished us, having happened to be at the tomb at daybreak, 24:23 and having not found his
body, they came, saying also, to have seen a vision of messengers, who are saying about him to be
living. 24:24 And some of the ones who were together-with us, went in the tomb and also found it so,
just-as the women said, but they did not see him.
    24:25
          And he himself said to them, O you° foolish ones and slow in heart to believe upon all which
the prophets spoke! 24:26 Was it not essential for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into his
glory? 24:27 And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he was clarifying for them in
all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. 24:28 And they drew near to the village, where they
were traveling and he himself was making-like that he was to travel farther.
    24:29
           And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, because it is toward dusk and the day has
been far-spent. And he entered in to abide together-with them. 24:30 And it happened, while* he was
reclining with them at the table, and having taken the bread, he gave-thanks and broke it and he was
giving it to them.
    24:31
          Now their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he became unapparent from them
{i.e., disappeared}. 24:32 And they said to one another, Was our heart not being burned inside us, as he
was speaking to us on the road, and as he was opening the Scriptures to us?
    24:33
           And having stood up in that same hour, they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven,


148                                                                                           mlvbible.com
having been accumulated together, and the ones together-with them, 24:34 saying, The Lord was really
raised and was seen by Simon. 24:35 And they themselves were describing the things which happened
on the road and how he was known by them in the breaking of the bread.
    {Mar 16:14 & Luk 24:36-43 & Joh 20:19-25 Sun. Evening.}
    24:36
          Now while they themselves are speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
them and says to them, Peace is to you°. 24:37 But they became terrified and fearful and were thinking
to be viewing a spirit. 24:38 And he said to them, Why are you° disturbed? And why do arguments
come-up in your° hearts? 24:39 Behold° my hands and my feet, that I am myself. Touch° me and see°,
because a spirit does not have flesh and bones, like you° view me having. 24:40 And having said this,
he showed them the hands and the feet. 24:41 But they themselves still disbelieving from the joy, and
marveling {i.e., they were in shock}; he said to them, Do you° have anything edible here? 24:42 Now they
gave part of a broiled fish to him and part from the honeycomb. 24:43 And having taken it, he ate it
in their sight.
    {Luk 24:44-49 & Acts 1:3-8 & 1Co 15:7 Jerusalem.}
    24:44
          Now he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you°, being still together-with
     °
you , that it is essential for all things to be fulfilled, which have been written in the Law of Moses
and the prophets and the Psalms, concerning me. 24:45 Then he opened their mind to understand the
Scriptures.
    {Mar 16:15-18 & Mat 28:18-20 & Luk 24:46-47 Mountain in Galilee; The Great Commission.}
    24:46
          And he said to them, Thus it has been written, and thus it was essential for the Christ to suffer
and to rise* up from the dead in the third day; {Isa 53:5?} 24:47 and repentance and forgiveness of sins
is to be preached in his name to all the nations, after it has began {i.e., starts} from Jerusalem. 24:48
Now you° are witnesses of these things. 24:49 And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon
you°, but you° sit {i.e., stay} in the city of Jerusalem, until you° should be clothed with power from on
high.
    {Mar 16:19-20 & Luk 24:50-53 & Acts 1:9-12 Olivet, between Jerusalem and Bethany.}
    24:50
          Now he led them outside until they were in Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and spoke
well of {and/or: gave-thanks for} them. 24:51 And it happened, while* he blessed them, he stood-apart
from them and was being carried up into heaven. 24:52 And they themselves, having worshiped him,
returned into Jerusalem with great joy 24:53 and they were always in the temple, praising and thanking
God.
    Amen.

                                             {{ Introduction to John 67-95 AD
    The Good-news account by John, which was most likely written after the other three, fills in some gaps that were not
covered by Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Eight percent of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are in John, and ninety-two percent
is unique to John through the Holy Spirit. No specific writer is stated but the similarities in writing style, thought patterns,
vocabulary and the ‘very’ Koine Greek language of the Good-news of John, 1-3 John, and Revelation (denoted as ‘John’)
is unmistakable. This ‘John’ was always assumed to be apostle John, the son of Zebedee.
    John writes to a general audience. John talks about the unbelieving Jews and equates them to the world. He also talks
about the Greek speaking Jews (Hellenistic) in this book and shows many witnesses confirming that Jesus is the Christ
prophesied of in the Old Testament. John states his purpose in 20:30, 31 where signs were recorded for a specific purpose
to bring about faith in Jesus. John recognizes that unless one has this faith (belief), he will not have eternal life. John also
explains what belief in Jesus really means in John 3:36 and that belief is obedience according to John through inspiration.
John begins his biography of Jesus by starting at the very creation of the world, showing Jesus as ‘The Word was God’
and ‘became flesh and resided among us’ (John 1:1-3, 14). If it help understand the preeminence of Jesus as God in
chapter one, the words: become, became, can be translated as “come into being”. From there, the focus is on showing
the life, teachings, and miracles of Jesus in such a way that the reader might ‘believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and that believing, the reader may have life in His name’ (John 20:30-31). So as you read this great book from God,
focus on how John builds the witnesses of Jesus, the signs, and wonders of God’s Son and how God brings about faith
and belief in the reader with confidence that Jesus is God’s Son. Among other things, it is in this Good-news account
that we learn that Jesus rejected the idea of setting up an earthly kingdom (John 6:15, 18:36). A later writing of John,
Revelation tells us he made for us, Christians, a kingdom, and we are the priests of God, Revelation 1:6.}}

     1:1
          The Word was in the beginning and the Word was with God and the Word was God. 1:2 This
one was in the beginning with God. 1:3 All things became through him, and without him not even one
thing became which has become into being. 1:4 Life was in him, and the life was the light of men. 1:5
And the light is appearing in the darkness, and the darkness did not overtake {Or: comprehend} it.
     1:6
         It happened that a man came, having been sent from God, and his name was John. 1:7 This one
came *for a testimony, in-order-that he might testify concerning the light, in-order-that all should
believe through him. 1:8 That he was not the light, but came in-order-that he might testify concerning
the light.
     1:9
         He was the true* light coming into the world, the light which illuminates every man. 1:10 He was
in the world and the world became through him and the world did not know him.
     1:11
          He came to his own and his own did not receive him. 1:12 But as many as received him, he gave
to them the authority to become children of God, to the ones who believe in his name, 1:13 who were
born, not from bloods, nor from the will of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.
     1:14
           And the Word became flesh and resided among us (and we saw his glory, glory like that of
the only begotten from the Father), full of favor and truth. 1:15 John testifies concerning him and
cried, saying, This one was he of whom I spoke, He who is coming after me, has become before me,
because he was first, then me. 1:16 And we all received out-of his fullness and favor in exchange-for
favor. 1:17 Because the law was given through Moses; the favor and the truth became through Jesus
Christ. 1:18 No one has seen God at anytime; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the
Father, that one has described him.

         And the ones who had been sent, were from the Pharisees. 1:25 And they asked him, and said
to him, Therefore, why do you immerse*, if you are not the Christ, neither Elijah, nor the prophet?
    1:26
         John answered them, saying, I immerse* in water, but one is standing in your° midst whom
you do not know. 1:27 It is he who is coming after me, who has become before me. I am not worthy
     °
that* I should loose the strap of his shoe. 1:28 These things happened in Bethany beyond-that area of
the Jordan, where John was immersing*.
    {Maybe: Mat 3:11-17, Mar 1:7-11, Luk 3:21-22 & Joh 1:29-34}
    1:29
         On the next-day he sees Jesus coming toward him and says, Behold, the Lamb of God, who
is taking away the sin of the world! 1:30 This one is he, concerning whom I said, A man is coming
after me who has become before me, because he was first; then me. 1:31 And I did not know him, but
in-order-that he should be manifested to Israel. I came immersing* in water because of this. 1:32 And
John testified, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained
upon him. 1:33 And I did not know him, but he who sent me to immerse* in water, that one said to me,
Upon whomever you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him, this one is he who
immerses* in the Holy Spirit. 1:34 And I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son of God.
    {Joh 1:35-51 Bethany beyond Jordan, Spring 27 AD.}
    1:35
         Again on the next-day, John and two others from his disciples stood around. 1:36 And having
looked at Jesus walking, he says, Behold, the Lamb of God! 1:37 And the two disciples heard him
speak and they followed Jesus.
    1:38
         Now Jesus, having turned, saw them following, and says to them, What are you° seeking?
    But they said to him, Rabbi (which is said, by translation: teacher), where do you abide?
    1:39
         He says to them, Come° and see°.
    They went and saw where he abides, and they remained with him that day. It was approximately
the tenth hour {i.e., 4:00 PM}. 1:40 One out-of the two who heard this from John was Andrew, Simon
Peter’s brother and he followed him. 1:41 This one finds first his own brother Simon and says to him,
We have found the Messiah (which is, after being translated, The Christ).
    1:42
         And he led him toward Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, You are Simon, the Son of Jonah,
you will be called Cephas, which is by translation, a Pebble.
    1:43
         On the next-day, he wished to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip, and Jesus says to him,
Follow me.
    1:44
         Now Philip was from Bethsaida, from the city of Andrew and Peter. 1:45 Philip finds Nathanael
and says to him, We have found whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote about, Jesus from
Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

     1:46
          And Nathanael said to him, Is any good thing able to be coming out-of Nazareth?
     Philip says to him, Come and behold!
     1:47
          Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and says concerning him, Behold, an Israelite in
whom there truly is no treachery!
     1:48
          Nathanael says to him, From where do you know me?
     Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip came to summon you, I saw you being under the
fig tree.
     1:49
          Nathanael answered and says to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of
Israel.
     1:50
          Jesus answered and said to him, Is it because I said to you, I saw you underneath the fig tree
that you believe? You will be seeing greater than these things. 1:51 And he says to him, Assuredly,
assuredly, I am saying to you°, From now on, you° will be seeing the heaven, having been opened,
and the messengers of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.

     2:1
          And there happened to be a marriage in Cana of Galilee in the third day, and the mother of
Jesus was there; 2:2 and Jesus was invited and his disciples to the marriage. 2:3 And having lacked
enough wine, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.
     2:4
         Jesus says to her, What is this thing with me and with you, woman? My hour is not coming yet.
     2:5
          His mother says to the servants, Anything whatever he may say to you°, do*° it. 2:6 Now six
stone water pots were placed there according-to the Jews’ cleansing, making room for two or three
nine-gallon measures apiece. {i.e., very large water pots}
     2:7
         Jesus says to them, Fill° the water pots from water nearby. And they filled them to the top. 2:8
And he says to them, Dip-out° some now and carry° it to the chief waiter.
     And they carried it. 2:9 Now as the chief waiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did
not know where it is from (but the servants knew, having dipped-out the water), the chief waiter
summons the bridegroom, 2:10 and says to him, Every man first places the good wine on the table,
and whenever they might be drunken, then the inferior. But you have kept the good wine until now.
2:11
     This one was the beginning of the signs which Jesus did* in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his
glory, and his disciples believed in him.
     {Joh 2:12 Capernaum; no parallel.}
     2:12
          After this, he went-down to Capernaum, he himself and his mother and his brethren and his
disciples, and they did not remain there many days. {An idiom: stayed a few days.}

          And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went-up to Jerusalem. 2:14 And he found,
sitting in the temple, the ones selling bulls and sheep and doves, and the money-changers. 2:15 And
he made* a scourge out-of ropes and cast all forth out-of the temple, both the sheep and the bulls, and
he poured out the coinage of the brokers and turned over their tables; 2:16 and to the ones selling the
doves he said, Take° these things from here. Do*° not make* my Father’s house a house of
merchandise.

            Now his disciples were reminded that it has been written, ‘Zeal of your house will be
devouring me.’ {Psa 69:9}
     2:18
           Therefore, the Jews answered and said to him, What sign are you showing to us? Why is it that
you are doing* these things?
     2:19
           Jesus answered and said to them, Tear-down° this temple and I will be lifting it up in three
days.
     2:20
           Therefore, the Jews said, This temple was built in forty-six years and you will be lifting it up
in three days? 2:21 But that he spoke concerning the temple of his body.
     2:22
           Therefore, when he was raised up from the dead, his disciples were reminded that he spoke
this, and they believed in the Scripture and the word in which Jesus had said.
     2:23
           Now as he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, many believed in his name at the feast, viewing
his signs which he was doing*. 2:24 But Jesus himself was not entrusting himself to them, because he
knows all people, 2:25 and because he had no need that* anyone should testify concerning man; for*
he himself knew what was in man.

         Now there was a man from the Pharisees, his name was Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 3:2 This
one came to him by night and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from
God; for* no one is able to do* these signs which you are doing*, if God is not with him.
     3:3
         Jesus answered and said to him, Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, If someone has not
been born anew, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.
     3:4
          Nicodemus says to him, How is a man able to be born, being elderly? He is not able to enter
into his mother’s womb a second-time and to be born again, is he?
     3:5
         Jesus answered, Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, If someone has not been born out-of
water and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God! 3:6 What has been born out-of
the flesh is flesh, and what has been born out-of the Spirit is spirit. 3:7 Do not marvel that I said to
you, It is essential for you° to be born anew. 3:8 The Spirit is blowing where he wills and you hear his
voice, but do not know from where he is coming and where he is proceeding-away, so is everyone
who has been born from the Spirit.
     3:9
          Nicodemus answered and said to him, How are these things able to happen?
     3:10
           Jesus answered and said to him, Are you the teacher of Israel and do not know these things?
3:11
       Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, We speak what we know, and testify from what we
have seen, and you° do not receive our testimony. 3:12 If I told you° the earthly things and you° do not
believe, how will you° believe if I should tell you° the heavenly things? 3:13 And no one has ascended
into heaven, except he who descended from heaven, that is, the Son of Man, who is in heaven. 3:14
And just-as Moses who exalted the serpent in the wilderness, so it is essential for the Son of Man
to also be exalted; 3:15 in-order-that everyone who believes in him might not perish but may have
everlasting life.
     3:16
           For* thus God loved* the world, so-that he gave his only begotten Son, in-order-that everyone

Son into the world in-order-that he might judge the world, but in-order-that the world might be saved
through him. 3:18 He who believes in him is not judged. But he who does not believe has been judged
already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
     3:19
           Now this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world and men loved* the darkness
rather than the light; for* their works were evil. 3:20 For* everyone who is practicing evil, hates the
light, and is not coming to the light, in-order-that his works should not convict him. 3:21 But he who
practices the truth comes to the light, in-order-that his works should be manifest, that they have been
worked in God.
     {Joh 3:22-36 Judea and Aenon; no parallel.}
     3:22
           After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea, and he was staying with
them and was immersing* there. 3:23 Now John was also immersing* in Aenon near Salem, because
many waters {i.e., ponds} were there, and they were coming* and were being immersed*. 3:24 For* John
was not yet being put into prison. 3:25 Therefore, it happened that a debate from John’s disciples with
a Jew concerning the cleansing. 3:26 And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with
you beyond-that area of the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, this one is immersing* and
everyone is going to him.
      3:27
           John answered and said, A man is able to receive nothing, if it is not given to him from
heaven. 3:28 You° yourselves testify, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I have been sent before
that one. 3:29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who is
standing and hearing him, rejoices with joy because of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore, in
this, my joy has been fulfilled. 3:30 It is essential for that to grow, but for me to be diminished.
     3:31
           He who is coming from above is over all. He who is from the earth is from the earth and
speaks from the earth. He who is coming from heaven is over all. 3:32 And what he has seen and
heard, he is testifying of this, and no one receives his testimony. 3:33 He who received his testimony
sealed this: that God is true*. 3:34 For* he whom God sent speaks the words of God; for* God does not
give the Spirit from measure. 3:35 The Father loves* the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
3:36
     The one believing in the Son has everlasting life, but the one who is disobedient to the Son will
not be seeing life, but the wrath of God is remaining upon him.

more disciples than John, 4:2 (although Jesus himself was not immersing*, but his disciples did), 4:3
he left Judea and went away into Galilee.
     4:4
          Now it was essential for him to go through Samaria.
     {Joh 4:5-43 Jacob’s Well and at Sychar; no parallel.}
     4:5
          Therefore, he comes to a city of Samaria, called* Sychar, close to the parcel of ground which
Jacob gave to his son Joseph, 4:6 and Jacob’s well was there. Therefore, Jesus, having labored from
the journey, was sitting thus upon the well. It was approximately the sixth hour {i.e., Noon}. 4:7 A
woman from Samaria comes to dip-out water. Jesus says to her, Give to me some water to drink. 4:8

For* his disciples had gone away into the city, in-order-that they might buy various nourishments.
    4:9
        Therefore, the Samaritan woman says to him, How do you, being a Jew, ask to drink from me,
being a Samaritan woman? (For* Jews have no dealings together-with Samaritans.)
    4:10
          Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you,
Give to me some water to drink; you would have asked him, and he would have given living water
to you.
    4:11
         The woman says to him, Lord, you have no bucket and the well is deep. Therefore, from where
do you have the living water? 4:12 You are not greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and
drank out-of it himself and his sons and his livestock, are you?
    4:13
          Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks from this water will be thirsty again 4:14
but whoever may drink from the water which I will be giving him should never be thirsty forever,
but the water which I will be giving him will become in him a well of water leaping up to everlasting
life.
    4:15
          The woman says to him, Lord, give this water to me in-order-that I may not be thirsty, nor
come here to dip-out water.
    4:16
          Jesus says to her, Proceed-away, summon your husband, and come here.
    4:17
          The woman answered and said, I have no husband.
    Jesus says to her, You said well, I have no husband, 4:18 for* you had five husbands, and he whom
you have now is not your husband. You have said this, a true* thing.
    4:19
          The woman says to him, Lord, I view that you are a prophet. 4:20 Our fathers worshiped in this
mountain, and you° Jews say, that in Jerusalem is the place where it is essential to worship.
    4:21
          Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, the hour is coming, when you° will be worshiping the
Father, neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem. 4:22 You° worship what you° do not know. We
worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews. 4:23 But the hour is coming and now is,
when the true* worshipers will be worshiping the Father in spirit and truth; for* the Father also is
seeking such who are worshiping him. 4:24 God is a Spirit, and it is essential for the ones who are
worshiping him to worship in spirit and truth.
     4:25
           The woman says to him, I know that the Messiah is coming (he who is called* Christ).
Whenever he comes, that man will be proclaiming all things to us.
    4:26
          Jesus says to her, I am he, who is speaking to you.
     4:27
           And his disciples came upon this, and marveled that he was speaking with a woman;
nevertheless, no one said, What are you seeking? Or, Why are you speaking with her?
    4:28
          Therefore, the woman left her water pot and went away into the city, and says to the men, 4:29
Come-here°. Behold°, a man who told me all things, as many things as I did*. This is not the Christ,
is it? 4:30 They went forth out-of the city and were coming toward him.
    4:31
          But in the time in between, the disciples were asking him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
    4:32
          But he said to them, I have food to eat which you° do not know.

          Therefore, the disciples were saying to one another, Someone did not bring him anything to
eat, did they?
    4:34
          Jesus says to them, My food is that* I should be doing* the will of the one who sent me, and
should complete his work. 4:35 Do you° not say, There are still four months and then the harvest
comes. Behold, I am saying to you°, Lift° up your° eyes and look° at the farmlands, because they are
already white for the harvest. 4:36 And he who is reaping receives wages and gathers fruit to

everlasting life; in-order-that he who is sowing and he who is reaping may rejoice also in unison. 4:37
For* the true* word is in this, Another is he who is sowing and another is he who is reaping. 4:38 I sent
you° forth to reap what you° have not labored; others have labored, and you° have entered into their
labor.
        4:39
             Now many out-of the Samaritans from that city believed in him, because of the word of the
woman, who was testifying, He told me all things, as many things as did*. 4:40 Therefore, as the
Samaritans came to him, they were asking him to abide with them, and he remained there two days.
4:41
     And many more believed because of his word; 4:42 and they were saying to the woman, We believe
no longer because of your speech; for* we ourselves have heard, and know that this is truly the Savior
of the world, the Christ.
     4:43
          Now after the two days, he went forth from there and went into Galilee. 4:44 For* Jesus himself
testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own fatherland.
     {Luk 4:14a & Joh 4:44-45 Arrival in Galilee.}
     4:45
           Therefore, when he came into Galilee, the Galileans accepted him, having seen all the things
which he did* in Jerusalem at the feast; for* they themselves had also gone to the feast.
     {Joh 4:46-54 Cana; no parallel.}
     4:46
           Therefore, Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where he made* the water wine. And there
was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick in Capernaum. 4:47 This one, having heard that Jesus is
coming out-of Judea into Galilee, he went toward him, and was asking him in-order-that he might
come-down and might heal his son; for* he was about to die. 4:48 Therefore, Jesus said to him, If you°
do not see signs and wonders, you° should never believe.
     4:49
           The nobleman says to him, Lord, come-down here before my child is to die.
     4:50
           Jesus says to him, Travel on; your son lives.
     And the man believed the word in which Jesus spoke to him, and he was traveling on.
     4:51
           Now already while going-down, his bondservants encountered him and reported, saying that
your boy lives. 4:52 Therefore, he inquired from them the hour in which he had improved. And they
said to him, The fever left him yesterday in the seventh hour {i.e., 1:00 PM}. 4:53 Therefore, the father
knew that it was in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself, and his
whole house believed. 4:54 This is again the second sign that Jesus did*, having gone out-of Judea into
Galilee.

multitude of the ones being sick, blind, lame, and dried up were laying in these waiting for the
moving of the water. 5:4 For* a messenger was descending every opportunity in the pool, and was
disturbing the water. Therefore, the first one who stepped after the disturbance of the water became
healthy, from whatever disease in which the one was being held.

this one reclining and having known that he has spent much time already there, he says to him, Do
you wish to become healthy?
    5:7
         The sick man answered him, Lord, I do not have a man in-order-that he might put me in the
pool whenever the water is disturbed. But while I am coming, another is going-down before me.
    5:8
        Jesus says to him, Lift yourself up, and take up your pallet and walk! 5:9 And immediately the
man became healthy, and lifted up his pallet and was walking.
    Now it was the Sabbath on that day. 5:10 Therefore, the Jews were saying to the one who had been
healed, It is the Sabbath. It is not legal for you to lift up your pallet.
    5:11
         He answered them, He who made* me healthy, that man said to me, Lift up your pallet and
walk.
    5:12
         Therefore, they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Lift up your pallet and walk? 5:13
But he who was healed did not know who it is; for* Jesus had slipped out of the crowd being in the
place.
    5:14
         After these things, Jesus finds him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become
healthy. Sin no longer, in-order-that something worse might not happen to you. 5:15 The man went
away and proclaimed to the Jews that Jesus is the one having made* him healthy. 5:16 And the Jews
were persecuting Jesus because of this, and were seeking to kill him, because he was doing* these
things on the Sabbath.
    5:17
         But Jesus answered them, My Father is working until now, and I am working. 5:18 Therefore,
the Jews were seeking even more to kill him because of this, because he was not only tearing-down
the Sabbath, but also that he was saying God is his own Father, making* himself equal to God.
    5:19
         Therefore, Jesus answered and said to them, Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, The
Son is not able to do* anything from himself, if he does not see what the Father is doing*. For*
whatever these things are that he is doing*, the Son is also doing* these things likewise. 5:20 For* the
Father loves the Son, and shows to him all things which he is doing*, and he will be showing him
greater works than these things in-order-that you° may marvel. 5:21 For* just-like the Father raises up
the dead and is giving-life to them, so the Son also is giving-life to whom he wills. 5:22 For* the Father
is not even judging anyone, but has given all judgment to the Son, 5:23 in-order-that all may honor the
Son, just-as they honor the Father. He who is not honoring the Son, is not honoring the Father who
sent him.
    5:24
         Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, He who hears my word and believes in the one who
sent me, has everlasting life, and is not coming into judgment, but has stepped out-of death into the
life.
    5:25
         Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, The hour is coming and now is, when the dead will
hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones who have heard will live. 5:26 For* just-like the Father
has life in himself, so he also gave to the Son, to have life in himself, 5:27 and he also gave authority
to him to make* judgment, because he is a son of man. 5:28 Do° not marvel at this, because the hour
is coming in which all the ones who are in the tombs will be hearing his voice, 5:29 and will travel
out; the ones who did* good things, to the resurrection of life, and the ones who practiced evil, to
the resurrection of judgment.
    5:30
          I am able to do* nothing from myself. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous,


158                                                                                         mlvbible.com
because I am not seeking my will, but the will of the Father who sent me. 5:31 If I testify concerning
myself, my testimony is not true*. 5:32 It is another who is testifying concerning me, and I know that
the testimony which he is testifying concerning me is true*. 5:33 You° have sent people forth to John,
and he has testified to the truth. 5:34 But the testimony which I receive is not from man, but I am
saying these things in-order-that you° might save yourselves. 5:35 He was that lamp which burns and
appears bright, and you° willed to be glad for a short-time in his light. 5:36 But the testimony which
I have is greater than John’s; for* the works which the Father gave to me in-order-that I should
complete them, the works themselves which I am doing*, testify concerning me, that the Father has
sent me. 5:37 And the Father who sent me, he has testified concerning me. You° have neither heard
his voice at anytime, nor have seen his form. 5:38 And you° do not have his word remaining in you°,
because you° do not believe in that man whom he sent for this. 5:39 You° are searching the Scriptures
because you° think to have everlasting life in them, and those are the ones testifying concerning me;
5:40
      and you° are not willing to come to me in-order-that you° may have life.
     5:41
          I am not receiving glory from men. 5:42 But I have known you°, that you° do not have the love*
of God in yourselves. 5:43 I have come in the name of my Father, and you° are not receiving me. If
another comes in his own name, you° will be receiving that man. 5:44 How are you° able to believe,
receiving glory from one another, and yet you° are not seeking the glory which is from the only God?
5:45
     Do° not think that I will be accusing you° to the Father. There is one who is accusing you°, Moses,
in whom you° have hoped. 5:46 For* if you° were believing in Moses, you° would be believing in me;
for* that man wrote concerning me. 5:47 But if you° do not believe the Scriptures of that man, how will
you° believe in my declarations?

     {Mar 6:30-32 & Mat 14:13 & Luk 9:10 & Joh 6:1 East shore of Galilee.}
     6:1
         After these things, Jesus went away to the area beyond-that of the sea of Galilee, to the sea of
Tiberias.
     {Mar 6:33-44 & Mat 14:13-21 & Luk 9:11-17 & Joh 6:2-14.}
     6:2
         And a large crowd was following him, because they were seeing his signs, which he was doing*
upon the ones who were sick.
     6:3
          Now Jesus went up into the mountain and was sitting there with his disciples. 6:4 Now the
Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. 6:5 Therefore, Jesus, having lifted up his eyes and having
seen that a large crowd is coming toward him, says to Philip, From where will we be buying bread
in-order-that these might eat? 6:6 But he said this, testing him; for* he himself knew what he was
about to do*.
     6:7
         Philip answered him, Two hundred denarii’ worth of loaves is not enough for them in-order-
that each of them might take some bit.
     6:8
          One out-of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, says to him, 6:9 There is one child
here, who has five barley loaves and two little-fish, but what are these things toward so-many?
     6:10
          But Jesus said, Make*° the men to lean-back. Now much grass was in the place. Therefore, the
men leaned-back, approximately five thousand in number. 6:11 Now Jesus took the loaves, and having
given-thanks, he distributed it to the disciples and then the disciples to the ones who are reclining;
also likewise from the little-fish as many as they were wishing to eat. 6:12 Now as they were getting


mlvbible.org                                                                                         159
filled, he says to his disciples, Gather° up the broken pieces which were leftover, in-order-that not
anything might perish. 6:13 Therefore, they gathered together and filled twelve baskets from the
broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were leftover by the ones who had been fed.
     6:14
          Therefore, after the men saw the sign which Jesus did*, they were saying, This truly is the
prophet who is coming into the world.
     {Mar 6:45-56 & Mat 14:22-36 & Joh 6:15-21.}
     6:15
          Therefore, Jesus, having known that they are about to come and seize him in-order-that they
might make* him king, departed by himself into the mountain alone.
     6:16
          Now as it became evening, his disciples went-down upon the sea coast; 6:17 and having stepped
into the ship, they were going beyond-that area of the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become
dark and Jesus had not yet come to them. 6:18 And the sea was being awakened by a great blowing
wind. 6:19 Therefore, having rowed approximately twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they view Jesus
walking upon the sea and happening to be near the ship and they were afraid. 6:20 But he says to them,
I am here. Do° not be afraid. 6:21 Therefore, they were willing to receive him onto the ship and
immediately the ship happened to be upon the land in which they were proceeding.
     {Joh 6:22-71 Synagogue in Capernaum; no parallel.}
     6:22
          On the next-day the crowd, the one standing beyond-that area of the sea, saw that no other
small-boat was there, except this one in which his disciples had stepped into, and that Jesus did not
enter together-with his disciples into the small-boat, but his disciples went away alone 6:23 (but other
small-boats came from Tiberias near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord gave-thanks).
6:24
      Therefore, when the crowd saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they themselves also
stepped into the ships and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 6:25 And having found him beyond-that
area of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come* here?
     6:26
          Jesus answered them and said, Assuredly, assuredly, I say to you°, You° are seeking me, not
because you° saw signs, but because you° ate from the loaves and were fully-fed. 6:27 Do° not work
for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to everlasting life, which the Son of Man
will be giving to you°; for* God, the Father, sealed this one.
     6:28
          Therefore, they said to him, What should we do* in-order-that we may work the works of God?
     6:29
          Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, in-order-that you° might believe
into that man whom he sent.
     6:30
          Therefore, they said to him, Therefore, what are you doing* for a sign in-order-that we may
see it and should believe in you? What are you working for us? 6:31 Our fathers ate the manna in the
wilderness; as it has been written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. {Exo 16:21, Num 11:8}
     6:32
          Therefore, Jesus said to them, Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, Moses has not given
the bread from heaven to you°, but my Father is the one giving the true* bread from heaven to you°.
6:33
      For* the bread of God is he who is descending from heaven and is giving life to the world.
     6:34
          Therefore, they said to him, Lord, give this bread to us always.
     6:35
          But Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life. The one coming to me should never hunger and
the one believing in me should never be thirsty at anytime. 6:36 But I said to you°, That you° have seen
me and are not believing this. 6:37 All which the Father gives me will be coming to me, and the one
who is coming to me I should never cast outside. 6:38 Because I have descended from heaven, not in-


160                                                                                           mlvbible.com
order-that I should do* my will, but do the will of the one who sent me. 6:39 But this is the will of my
Father who sent me, that* of all which he has given me, I should not lose any out-of it, but will raise*
it up in the last day. 6:40 But this is the will of the one who sent me, in-order-that everyone who views
the Son and believes in him, may have everlasting life, and I will raise* him up in the last day.
     6:41
          Therefore, the Jews were murmuring concerning him, because he said, I am the bread who
descended from heaven. 6:42 And they were saying, Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father
and mother we know? Therefore, how is he saying this, that I descended from heaven?
     6:43
          Therefore, Jesus answered and said to them, Do° not murmur with one another. 6:44 No one is
able to come to me, if the Father who sent me should not attract him and I will raise* him up in the
last day. 6:45 It has been written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught from God.’ {Isa 54:13}
Therefore, everyone who hears from the Father and has learned, is coming to me. 6:46 Not that anyone
has seen the Father, except he who is from God, this one has seen the Father. 6:47 Assuredly,
assuredly, I am saying to you°, The one believing in me has everlasting life. 6:48 I am the bread of life.
6:49
      Your° fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died. 6:50 This is the bread who is
descending from heaven in-order-that anyone may eat from it and may not die. 6:51 I am the living
bread who descended from heaven; if anyone eats from this bread, he will be living forever and also
the bread which I will be giving is my flesh, which I will be giving on behalf of the life of the world.
     6:52
          Therefore, the Jews were quarreling with one another, saying, How is this one able to give us
his flesh to eat?
     6:53
          Therefore, Jesus said to them, Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, If you° do not eat the
flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you° do not have life in yourselves. 6:54 He who eats my
flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I will raise* him up in the last day. 6:55 For* my
flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink. 6:56 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides
in me and I in him. 6:57 Just-as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father; so he who
eats me, he will also be living because of me. 6:58 This is the bread who descended from heaven not
like the manna your° fathers ate and died; he who is eating this bread will be living forever. 6:59 He
said these things in the synagogue, while teaching in Capernaum.
     6:60
          Therefore, many out-of his disciples, having heard this, said, This is a harsh speech; who is
able to hear it?
     6:61
          But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples are murmuring concerning this, said to them,
Is this offending you°? 6:62 Therefore, what if you° view the Son of Man ascending where he was
beforehand? 6:63 It is the spirit who is giving-life; the flesh profits nothing. The words which I speak
to you° are spirit and are life. 6:64 But there are some out-of you° who do not believe. For* Jesus knew
from the beginning who they are who do not believe and who is one who will be giving him up. 6:65
And he said, Because of this, I have said to you°, that no one is able to come to me, if it is not given
to him from my Father.
     6:66
          Many of his disciples went away from this speech to things left behind and were walking no
more with him. 6:67 Therefore, Jesus said to the twelve, You° are not wishing to proceed-away also,
are you°?
     6:68
          Therefore, Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom will we go? You have the words of
everlasting life. 6:69 And we have believed and have known that you are the Christ the Son of the
living God.

    6:70
          Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you° the twelve and one out-of you° is a slanderer? 6:71
Now he was speaking of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, being one out-of the twelve, for* this one was
about to give him up to the Jews.
                                                 [John 7] TOC
    {Mar 7:1-23 & Mat 15:1-20 & Joh 7:1 Galilee, probably Capernaum Spring 29 AD.}
    7:1
        And after these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee; for* he was not wishing to walk in Judea,
because the Jews were seeking to kill him.
    {Joh 7:2-9; Galilee, probably Capernaum. Sept., 29 AD.}
    7:2
         Now the feast of the Jews, that is, the Feast of Tent-pitching {i.e., Tabernacles} was near. 7:3
Therefore, his brethren said to him, Go-away from here and proceed-away into Judea, in-order-that
your disciples may also view your works which you are doing* 7:4 for* no one does* anything in
secret, and then seeks for himself to be known publicly. If you are doing* these things, manifest
yourself to the world. 7:5 For* even his brethren were not believing into him. 7:6 Therefore, Jesus says
to them, My time is not yet here, but your° time is always ready. 7:7 The world is not able to hate you°,
but it hates me, because I am testifying concerning it, that its works are evil. 7:8 You°, go-up° to this
feast. I am not going-up to this feast yet, because my time has not yet been fulfilled.
    7:9
         Now having said these things to them, he remained behind in Galilee.
    {Luk 9:51-56 & Joh 7:10; Samaria, Sept., 29 AD.}
    7:10
          Now as his brethren went-up to the feast, then he also went-up, not openly, but like in secret.
    {Joh 7:11-10:21; Jerusalem, Oct., 29 AD; no parallel.}
    7:11
         Therefore, the Jews were seeking him at the feast and were saying, Where is that man? 7:12 And
there was much murmuring among the crowds concerning him. Some were saying, He is a good
man; others said, Not so, but he misleads the crowd. 7:13 Nevertheless no one was publicly speaking
concerning him because of fear of the Jews.
     7:14
           But while it is already in the middle of the feast, Jesus went-up into the temple and was
teaching. 7:15 And the Jews were marveling, saying, How did this one know the Scriptures, having
not learned them?
    7:16
          Therefore, Jesus answered them and said, My teaching is not my teaching, but is from the one
who sent me. 7:17 If anyone is willing to practice his will, he will know concerning the teaching, of
what sort it is, whether from God or I speak from myself. 7:18 He who speaks from himself is seeking
his own glory, but he who is seeking the glory from the one who sent him, this one is true* and no
unrighteousness is in him. 7:19 Has Moses not given you° the law and yet none out-of you° are
practicing the law? Why do you° seek to kill me?
    7:20
          The crowd answered and said, You have a demon. Who seeks to kill you?
    7:21
          Jesus answered and said to them, I did* one work and you° all marvel. 7:22 Because of this,
Moses has given you° circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the
Sabbath you° circumcise a man. 7:23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath in-order-that the
Law of Moses should not be torn-down, are you° bitterly-angry with me, because I made* a man


162                                                                                            mlvbible.com
                                       7:24
entirely healthy on the Sabbath?            Do° not judge according-to appearance, but judge° righteous
judgment.
      7:25
           Therefore, some out-of the ones from Jerusalem said, Is this not the one whom they are
seeking to kill? 7:26 And behold, he speaks publicly and they say nothing to him. Maybe the rulers
truly have known {Or: recognized} that this one is truly the Christ. 7:27 But we know where this one is
from, but whenever the Christ comes, no one knows from where he is coming.
     7:28
           Therefore, Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You° both know me and know
where I am from, and I have not come from myself, but he who sent me is true*, whom you° do not
know. 7:29 I know him, because I am from him and he sent me. 7:30 Therefore, they were seeking to
arrest him and yet no one put their hand upon him (because his hour had not come yet).
     7:31
          But many out-of the crowd believed in him, and they were saying, Whenever the Christ comes,
he will not be doing* signs more-than these which this one did*, will he? 7:32 The Pharisees heard the
crowd murmuring these things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the high-priests sent attendants
in-order-that they might arrest him.
     7:33
           Therefore, Jesus said, I am still with you° for a little time and I proceed-away to the one who
sent me. 7:34 You° will be seeking me and will not be finding me and where I am, you° are not able
to come.
     7:35
           Therefore, the Jews said to themselves, Where is this one about to travel that we will not be
finding him? He is not about to travel to the Dispersion of the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?
7:36
     What is this speech which he said, You° will be seeking me and will not be finding me, and where
I am, you° are not able to come?
     7:37
           Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone is
thirsty, let him come to me and let him drink. 7:38 The one believing in me, like the Scripture has said,
Rivers of living water will be flowing out-of his belly. {Joh 4:14} 7:39 But he spoke this concerning the
Spirit, of which the ones who believe in him were about to receive; for* the Holy Spirit was not yet
given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
     7:40
           Therefore, many out-of the crowd, having heard the word, said, This is truly the prophet.
     7:41
           Others were saying, This one is the Christ. Others were saying, For* the Christ does not come
out-of Galilee, does he? 7:42 Did the Scripture not say that the Christ comes out-of the seed of David
and from Bethlehem, the village where David was? {2Sam. 7:12, Mic 5:2} 7:43 Therefore, a split
happened in the crowd because of him. 7:44 But some out-of them were wishing to arrest him, but no
one put hands upon him.
     7:45
           Therefore, the attendants came to the high-priests and Pharisees, and those men said to them,
Why have you° not led him here?
     7:46
           The attendants answered, A man never spoke thus, like this man.
     7:47
           Therefore, the Pharisees answered them, You° have not also been misled, have you? 7:48 Not
anyone from the rulers or from the Pharisees believed in him, have they? 7:49 But this crowd who does
not know the law are cursed.
     7:50
           Nicodemus says to them (he who came to him by night, being one out-of them), 7:51 Our law
is not judging a man, if it does not hear from him beforehand and may know what he is doing*, does
it?
     7:52
           They answered and said to him, You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search and behold


mlvbible.org                                                                                           163
that no prophet has been raised up out-of Galilee.
    7:53
          And each traveled to his own house, [John 8] TOC 8:1 but Jesus traveled to the Mountain of
Olives.
    8:2
        Now from daybreak, he came* again into the temple and all the people were coming to him, and
having sat down, he was teaching them.
    8:3
        Now the scribes and the Pharisees lead a woman having been overtaken in adultery to him. And
having stood her in the middle of them, 8:4 they say to him, testing him, Teacher, this woman was
overtaken in the very-act of committing adultery. 8:5 Now Moses commanded us in the law such ones
are to be stoned. Therefore, what do you say? 8:6 But they were saying this thing, testing him in-order-
that they may have something to accuse him.
    But Jesus stooped downward and was writing in the soil with his finger and making-like not
anything was happening. 8:7 Now as they were remaining, asking him, he stood-erect and said to
them, Let your° sinless ones cast the first stone upon her. 8:8 And again he stooped downward and
was writing in the soil.
    8:9
        Now the ones having heard it and being convicted by their conscience, they were going out one
by one, having begun from the elders ones and Jesus was being left alone, and the woman being in
his midst.
    8:10
         Now Jesus stood-erect and saw no one other-than the woman and said to her, Where are those
men, your accusers? Did no one condemn you?
    8:11
          Now she said, No one, Lord.
    Now Jesus said, Neither do I judge you. Travel on and sin no longer!
    8:12
          Therefore, again Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world. The one following
me should never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.
    8:13
          Therefore, the Pharisees said to him, You are testifying concerning yourself; your testimony
is not true*.
    8:14
          Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true*,
because I know from where I came and where I am proceeding-away to, but you° do not know from
where I come and where I am proceeding-away to. 8:15 You° judge according-to the flesh; I judge no
one according-to the flesh. 8:16 And even if I judge, my judgment is true*, because I am not alone, but
I and the Father who sent me. 8:17 And also it has been written in your° law, that the testimony of two
men is true*. {Deu 19:15} 8:18 I am the one testifying concerning myself and the Father who sent me
is testifying concerning me.
    8:19
          Therefore, they were saying to him, Where is your Father?
    Jesus answered, You° know neither me, nor my Father; if you° knew me, you° would also know
my Father. 8:20 (Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, while teaching in the temple and no one
arrested him, because his hour had not come yet.)
    8:21
          Therefore, Jesus said again to them, I am proceeding-away and you° will be seeking me and
will be dying in your° sin; where I am proceeding-away to, you° are not able to come.
     8:22
           Therefore, the Jews were saying, Will he kill himself, because he says, Where I am
proceeding-away to, you° are not able to come?
    8:23
          And he said to them, You° are from below; I am from above. You° are from this world; I am
not from this world. 8:24 Therefore, I said to you°, that you° will be dying in your° sins; for* if you° do


164                                                                                          mlvbible.com
not believe that I am, you° will be dying in your° sins.
    8:25
          Therefore, they were saying to him, Who are you?
    And Jesus said to them, The beginning, which is something that I am also speaking to you°. 8:26
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you°, but he who sent me is true*, and the things
which I heard from him, I am saying these things to the world. 8:27 (They did not know that he spoke
concerning the Father to them.) 8:28 Therefore, Jesus said to them, Whenever you° exalt the Son of
Man, then you° will know that I am he and that I am doing* nothing from myself, but just-as my
Father taught me, I am speaking these things to the world. 8:29 And he who sent me is with me; the
Father did not leave me alone, because I am always doing* those things pleasing to him. 8:30 While
speaking these things, many believed in him.
    8:31
         Therefore, Jesus was saying to the Jews who have believed in him, If you° abide in my word,
then you° truly are my disciples; 8:32 and you° will know the truth and the truth will be making you°
free. 8:33 They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed and have been enslaved to no one at anytime.
How do you say, You° will become free?
    8:34
          Jesus answered them, Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, Everyone who practices sin
is the bondservant of sin.
     8:35
           Now the bondservant does not abide in the house forever; the son abides forever. 8:36
Therefore, if the Son should make you° free, you° really will be free. 8:37 I know that you° are
Abraham’s seed; but you° are seeking to kill me, because my word is not making room in you° in
your° hearts. 8:38 I am speaking what I have seen from my Father and therefore, you° are practicing
what you° have seen from your° father.
    8:39
          They answered and said to him, Our father is Abraham.
    Jesus says to them, If you° were Abraham’s children, were you° ever practicing the works of
Abraham? 8:40 But now you° are seeking to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you°, which
I heard from God. Abraham did not ever do* this. 8:41 You° are practicing the works of your° father.
    Therefore, they said to him, We have not been born from fornication; we have one Father, God.
    8:42
         Therefore, Jesus said to them, If God was your° Father, you° would love* me; for* I came forth
and am coming from God; for* neither have I come from myself, but from that one who sent me. 8:43
Why do you° not know my speech? Is it because you° are not able to hear my word? 8:44 You° are from
your° father, the devil, and you° are willing to do* the lusts of your° father. That one was a murderer
from the beginning and is not standing in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he
speaks a lie, he speaks from his own things, because he is a liar and the father of it. 8:45 But because
I speak the truth, you° do not believe me. 8:46 Which out-of you° convicts me concerning sin? But if
I speak the truth, why are you° not believing in me? 8:47 He who is from God hears the declarations
of God, but because of this, you° do not hear them, because you° are not from God.
    8:48
          Therefore, the Jews answered and said to him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan
and you have a demon?
    8:49
         Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I am honoring my Father and you° are dishonoring
me. 8:50 But I am not seeking my glory. There is one who is seeking and is judging. 8:51 Assuredly,
assuredly, I am saying to you°, If anyone keeps my word, he should never view his death forever.
    8:52
          Therefore, the Jews said to him, Now we have known that you have a demon. Abraham died
and the prophets, and you say, If anyone keeps my word, he should never taste of death forever. 8:53
You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? And the prophets died; whom are


mlvbible.org                                                                                         165
you making* yourself out to be?
      8:54
            Jesus answered, If I am glorifying myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who is
glorifying me; of whom you° say, that he is our God. 8:55 And you° have not known him, but I know
him, and if I say, I do not know him, I will be similar to you°, a liar, but I know him and I am keeping
his word. 8:56 Your° father Abraham was glad that* he might see my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.
      8:57
            Therefore, the Jews said to him, You do not yet have fifty years in and you have seen
Abraham?
     8:58
           Jesus said to them, Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, Before Abraham is to be born,
          8:59
I am.          Therefore, they took up stones in-order-that they might cast them at him, but Jesus was
hidden and went forth out-of the temple, having gone right through the middle of them and so he was
passing by them.
                                               [John 9] TOC
     9:1
          And passing by, he saw a man blind from his birth. 9:2 And his disciples asked him, saying,
Rabbi, who sinned, this one or his parents, that* he should be born blind?
     9:3
          Jesus answered, Neither did this one sin, nor his parents, but in-order-that the works of God
should be manifest in him. 9:4 It is essential for me to work the works of the one who sent me, insofar
as it is a day. The night is coming, when no one is able to work. 9:5 Whenever I am in the world, I am
the light of the world. 9:6 Having said these things, he spits on the level-ground and made* clay from
the spit and anointed the clay upon the eyes of the blind man, 9:7 and said to him, Proceed-away, wash
in the pool of Siloam (which is by translation, Sent). Therefore, he went away and washed and came
back seeing.
     9:8
         Therefore, the neighbors and the ones viewing him beforehand, that he was blind, were saying,
Is this one not the one, sitting and begging earlier? 9:9 Others were saying, This one is he. But others
said, He is similar to him.
     That man said, I am him.
     9:10
           Therefore, they were saying to him, How were your eyes opened?
     9:11
           That man answered and said, A man called* Jesus made* clay and anointed my eyes and said
to me, Proceed-away to the pool of Siloam and wash. And I went away and washed and I recovered
my sight.
     9:12
           Therefore, they said to him, Where is that man?
     He says, I do not know.
     9:13
           They lead him to the Pharisees, the previously blind one. 9:14 Now it was the Sabbath when
Jesus made* the clay and opened his eyes. 9:15 Therefore, again the Pharisees were also asking him
how he recovered his sight.
     Now he said to them, He placed clay upon my eyes and I washed and I can see.
     9:16
           Therefore, some out-of the Pharisees were saying, This man is not from God, because he is
not keeping the Sabbath.
     Others said, How is a man, a sinner, able to do* such signs? And there was a split among them.
9:17
     They say to the blind man again, What do you say concerning him, in that he opened your eyes?
     Now he said, He is a prophet.
     9:18
           Therefore, the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he was blind and had recovered his
sight, until which time they summoned the parents of the one who had recovered his sight, 9:19 and


166                                                                                        mlvbible.com
asked them, saying, Is this your° son, who you° say was born blind? Therefore, how does he see now?
     9:20
          But his parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son and that he was born
blind; 9:21 but how he can now see, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He
has come of age*; ask° him; he will be speaking concerning himself. 9:22 His parents said these things,
because they were fearing the Jews; for* the Jews, themselves, had covenanted* together already, in-
order-that if anyone confesses him as Christ, he should become expelled from the synagogue. 9:23
Because of this, his parents said, He has come of age*; ask° him.
     9:24
          Therefore, they summoned the man who was blind a second-time and said to him, Give glory
to God. We know that this man is a sinner.
     9:25
          Therefore, that man answered and said, I do not know if he is a sinner. I know one thing, that
being blind, but now I can see.
     9:26
          But they said to him again, What did he do* to you? How did he open your eyes?
     9:27
          He answered them, I spoke to you° already and you° did not hear; why are you° wishing to hear
it again? Do you° wish also to become his disciples?
     9:28
          They reviled him and said, You are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses. 9:29
We know that God has spoken to Moses, but this one, we do not know where he is from.
     9:30
          The man answered and said to them, For* a marvelous thing is in this, because you° do not
know where he is from and yet he opened my eyes. 9:31 But we know that God does not hear sinners,
but if anyone is God-fearing and if he is practicing his will, he hears this one. 9:32 It was not heard
from the beginning of the world, that anyone opened the eyes of one who has been born blind. 9:33
If this one was not from God, he was not able to do* anything {i.e., he would be unable to...}.
     9:34
          They answered and said to him, You were born entirely in sins and you are teaching us! And
they cast him outside.
     9:35
          Jesus heard that they had cast him outside, and having found him, he said to him, Do you
believe in the Son of God?
     9:36
          That man answered and said, Who is he, Lord, in-order-that I should believe in him?
     9:37
          Now Jesus said to him, You have both seen him and he who speaks with you is that man.
     9:38
          But he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.
     9:39
          And Jesus said, I came into this world *for judgment, in-order-that the ones who do not see,
may see, and the ones who see, may become blind.
     9:40
          And the ones who are with him from the Pharisees heard these things and said to him, We are
not also blind, are we?
     9:41
          Jesus said to them, If you° were blind, you° would have no sin, but now you° say, We see,
therefore, your° sin remains.
                                              [John 10] TOC
     10:1
          Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, He who does not enter in through the door into the
sheep’s pen, but goes-up elsewhere, that man is a thief and a robber. 10:2 But the one entering through
the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 10:3 The doorkeeper opens to this one, and the sheep hear his
voice and he calls his own sheep according-to name and leads them out. 10:4 And whenever he cast
forth his own sheep, he travels before them and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.
10:5
      But they should never follow another man, but will be fleeing from him, because they do not
know the voice of others. 10:6 (Jesus spoke this metaphor to them, but those men did not know what


mlvbible.org                                                                                         167
it was which he was speaking to them.)
    10:7
          Therefore, Jesus said again to them, Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, I am the door
of the sheep. 10:8 All, as many as came before are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear
them. 10:9 I am the door; if anyone enters through me, he will be saved and will enter and will go forth
and will find pasture. 10:10 The thief does not come, except that* he may steal, and may sacrifice and
may destroy you. I came in-order-that they may have life and may have it even-more. 10:11 I am the
good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life on behalf of the sheep. 10:12 But the hired-
servant and not being the shepherd, whose sheep are not his own, views the wolf coming and leaves
the sheep and flees and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep. 10:13 Now the hired-servant flees
because he is a hired-servant and he himself does not care concerning the sheep. 10:14 I am the good
shepherd, and I know my sheep and I am known by mine, 10:15 just-as the Father knows me and I
know the Father, and I lay down my life on behalf of the sheep. 10:16 And I have other sheep, which
are not out-of this pen; it is also essential for me to lead those and they will be hearing my voice and
there will become one flock, one shepherd. 10:17 Because of this, the Father loves* me, because I lay
down my life in-order-that I may again take it. 10:18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down away
from myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it up again. I received this
commandment from my Father.
    10:19
          Therefore, a split again happened among the Jews because of these words. 10:20 And many out-
of them were saying, He has a demon and is insane; why are you° listening to him?
    10:21
          Others were saying, These things are not the words of one being demon-possessed. A demon
is not able to open the eyes of the blind, is it?
    {Joh 10:22-42; Jerusalem and beyond Jordan; no parallel.}
    10:22
          Now it happened to be Hanukkah in Jerusalem and it was winter, 10:23 and Jesus was walking
in the temple in Solomon’s porch. 10:24 Therefore, the Jews surrounded him and were saying to him,
Until when, are you lifting this question from our soul: tell us frankly, if you are the Christ?
    10:25
           Jesus answered them, I spoke to you° and you° do not believe. The works which I am doing*
in my Father’s name, these are testifying concerning me. 10:26 But you° do not believe, for* you° are
not from my sheep just-as I said to you°. 10:27 My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they are
following me, 10:28 and I give to them everlasting life, and they themselves should never perish
forever and not anyone will be seizing them from my hand. 10:29 My Father, who has given them to
me, he is greater than all, and no one is able to seize them out-of my Father’s hand. 10:30 I and the
Father are one. 10:31 Therefore, the Jews bore stones again in-order-that they might stone him. 10:32
Jesus answered them, I showed you° many good works from my Father, because of what work from
them do you° stone me?
     10:33
            The Jews answered him, saying, We do not stone you concerning a good work, but
concerning blasphemy, and because you being a man, are making* yourself God.
    10:34
           Jesus answered them, Has it not been written in your° law, that I said, You° are gods? {Psa
82:6} 10:35 If he called* those men gods, to whom the word of God came* (and the Scripture is not able
to be torn-down), 10:36 do you° say of him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, You°
blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God? 10:37 If I am not doing* the works of my Father, then
do° not believe in me. 10:38 But if I am doing* them, even if you° do° not believe in me, believe° in the
works; in-order-that you° may know and may believe that the Father is in me and I am in him. 10:39

Therefore, they were again seeking to arrest him and he went forth out-of their hand.
     10:40
           And he went away again beyond-that area of the Jordan into the place where John was first
immersing*, and he remained there. 10:41 And many came to him and they were saying, John indeed
did* no sign, but all things, as many things as John spoke concerning this one were true*. 10:42 And
many believed in him there.

     {Joh 11:1-46; Peraea to Bethany, Jan. 30 AD; no parallel.}
     11:1
           Now a certain one was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, from the village of Mary and her sister
Martha. 11:2 Now it was this Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her
hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 11:3 Therefore, the sisters sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he
whom you love is sick.
    11:4
          But having heard it, Jesus said, This sickness is not to death, but on behalf of the glory of God,
in-order-that the Son of God may be glorified through it. 11:5 Now Jesus loved* Martha and her sister
and Lazarus. 11:6 Therefore, as he heard that he was sick, then indeed, he remained in the place in
which he was for two days. 11:7 Thereafter, after this time, he says to the disciples, We should be
proceeding into Judea again.
     11:8
           The disciples say to him, Rabbi, the Jews just now were seeking to stone you, and you are
proceeding back there again?
     11:9
          Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he is not
stumbling, because he sees the light of this world. 11:10 But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles,
because the light is not in him. 11:11 He spoke these things and he says to them after this, Our friend
Lazarus has fallen-asleep, but I am traveling in-order-that I may wake him.
     11:12
           Therefore, the disciples said to him, Lord, if he has fallen-asleep, he will be cured.
     11:13
            (Now Jesus had spoken concerning his death, but those men thought that he is speaking
concerning the restfulness of sleep.) 11:14 Therefore, then Jesus spoke to them frankly, Lazarus died.
11:15
      And I rejoice because of you° that I myself was not there, in-order-that you° may believe; but we
should proceed to him.
     11:16
            Therefore, Thomas, who is called* Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, We should also
proceed, in-order-that we may die with him.
     11:17
           Therefore, Jesus went and found him the one having been in the tomb for four days already.
11:18
      Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, approximately fifteen furlongs away from it; 11:19 and many
from the Jews had come to the ones around Martha and Mary in-order-that they may console them
concerning their brother. 11:20 Therefore, Martha, as she heard that Jesus is coming, met with him,
but Mary was sitting in the house. 11:21 Therefore, Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you were here, my
brother would have not died. 11:22 But even now I know that, as many things as you would ask of God,
God will be giving to you.
     11:23
           Jesus says to her, Your brother will rise* up again.
     11:24
           Martha says to him, I know that he will rise* up in the resurrection on the last day.
    11:25
           Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. The one believing in me, even if he dies,
he will be living; 11:26 and everyone, the one living and believing in me should never die forever. Do

you believe this?
   11:27
          She says to him, Yes, Lord. I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who
comes into the world. 11:28 And having said these things, she went away and secretly summoned Mary
her sister, and said, The Teacher is here and is summoning you. 11:29 As that woman heard it, she
arises quickly and comes to him. 11:30 (Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the
place where Martha met with him.)
   11:31
          Therefore, the Jews who are with her in the house and consoling her, after they saw Mary,
that she stood up quickly and went forth, they followed her, saying, She is proceeding-away to the
tomb in-order-that she may weep there.
    11:32
          Therefore, Mary, as she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell down at his feet there*,
saying to him, Lord, if you were here, my brother would have not died.
   11:33
          Therefore, as Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came together-with her,
he sighed in the spirit and was disturbed in himself, 11:34 and said, Where have you° placed him?
   They say to him, Lord, come and behold.
   11:35
          Jesus shed-tears.
   11:36
          Therefore, the Jews were saying, Behold how he loved him!
   11:37
          But some out-of them said, Was this one, who opened the eyes of the blind man, not able to
do* something in-order-that this one might not have even died?
   11:38
          Therefore, Jesus again, sighing in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave and a stone
was laying upon it. 11:39 Jesus says, Lift° up the stone.
   Martha, the sister of the one who had died, says to him, Lord, already the body stinks from decay;
for* it is four days old.
   11:40
          Jesus says to her, Did I not say to you, that, if you believe, you will be seeing the glory of
        11:41
God?          Therefore, they lifted the stone where the one who died was laying. Now Jesus lifted his
eyes upward and said, Father, I am giving-thanks to you because you heard me. 11:42 And I knew that
you always hear me, but I said it, because of the crowd, the crowd standing around, in-order-that they
should believe that you sent me. 11:43 And having said these things, he cried-out with a loud voice,
Lazarus, come-here! Come outside! 11:44 And he came forth, the one who had died, having been
bound hands and feet with burial wrappings, and his vision had been bound with a handkerchief.
Jesus says to them, Loose° him and allow° him to proceed-away.
   11:45
          Therefore, many out-of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did*, believed in
him. 11:46 But some out-of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus
did*.
   {Joh 11:47-54; Jerusalem and Ephraim in Judea; no parallel.}
    11:47
          Therefore, the high-priests and the Pharisees gathered together a council and were saying,
What are we doing* because this man is doing* many signs? 11:48 If we should allow him to continue

          But a certain one out-of them, Caiaphas, being the high-priest of that year, said to them, You°
know nothing, 11:50 nor are you° reasoning that it is advantageous for us that* one man should die on
behalf of the people and that* the whole nation should not perish. 11:51 (Now he said this not from
himself, but being high-priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die on behalf of the
nation; 11:52 and not only on behalf of the nation, but in-order-that he should also gather together into
one the children of God who have been scattered.) 11:53 Therefore, they planned together from that

day forth in-order-that they might kill him.
    11:54
           Therefore, Jesus was not walking publicly anymore among the Jews, but went away from
there into the region near to the wilderness, into a city called* Ephraim, and he was staying there with
his disciples.

           Now the Passover of the Jews was near and many went-up to Jerusalem out-of the region
before the Passover, in-order-that they might purify themselves. 11:56 Therefore, they were seeking
Jesus and were speaking with one another while standing in the temple, What are you° thinking? He
should never come to the feast, or should he? 11:57 Now both the high-priests and the Pharisees had
given a commandment in-order-that, if anyone should know where he is, he should divulge it, *that
they might arrest him.

    12:1
         Therefore, Jesus came to Bethany six days before the Passover, where Lazarus was, who had
died, whom he raised from the dead.

    12:2
         Therefore, they made* him a supper there and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the
ones who are reclining at the meal together-with him. 12:3 Therefore, Mary took a pound of perfume
of precious full-strength nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the
house was filled from the aroma of the perfume. 12:4 Therefore, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, one out-
of his disciples, who is about to give him up, says, 12:5 Why was this perfume not sold* for three
hundred denarii and given to the poor? 12:6 Now he said this, not because he himself was caring
concerning the poor, but because he was a thief and had the box and was bearing what was put in
it.
    12:7
          Therefore, Jesus said, Allow her, she has kept it *for the day of my burial. 12:8 For* the poor
you always have with yourselves, but you° do not always have me.

    12:9
         Therefore, a large crowd out-of the Jews knew that he is there and they came, not only because
of Jesus, but in-order-that they might also see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. 12:10 But
the high-priests planned in-order-that they might also kill Lazarus; 12:11 that because of him, many
of the Jews were proceeding-away and were believing into Jesus.
    12:12
           A large crowd came to the feast on the next-day, having heard that Jesus is coming into
Jerusalem, 12:13 and they took the limbs of the palm-trees and went forth to a meeting with him and
they were crying out, Hosanna. The one coming in the name of the Lord has been blessed, the King
of Israel!
    12:14
          Now Jesus, having found a foul, sat upon it; as it has been written, 12:15 ‘Do not fear, daughter
of Zion. Behold, your King is coming, sitting upon a donkey’s young-donkey.’ {Isa 40:9, 62:11, Zec 9:9}

       (But his disciples did not know these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they were
reminded that these things had been written upon the basis of him and that they did* these things to
him.)
    12:17
           Therefore, the crowd who is with him was witnessing when he summoned Lazarus out-of the
tomb and raised him up from the dead. 12:18 The crowd also met him because of this thing, because
it heard that he himself had done* this sign. 12:19 Therefore, the Pharisees said to themselves, You°
are viewing that you° profit nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.
     {Joh 12:20-50 In the Temple, Tues.; no parallel.}
     12:20
            Now some Greeks from the ones coming-up were there in-order-that they might worship at
the feast; 12:21 therefore, these came to Philip, the one from Bethsaida of Galilee and was asking him,
saying, Lord, we wish to see Jesus. 12:22 Philip comes and speaks to Andrew, and Andrew and Philip
speak again to Jesus.
      12:23
             But Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that* the Son of Man should be
glorified. 12:24 Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, If a kernel of the grain did not fall into the
soil and died, it remains alone, but if it itself dies, it is bringing forth much fruit. 12:25 He who loves
his life will be losing it, and he who hates his life in this world will be keeping it to everlasting life.
12:26
       If anyone serves me, let him follow me, and where I am, my servant will also be there. And if
anyone serves me, the Father will be honoring him. 12:27 Now my soul has been disturbed, and what
should I say? Father, save me from this hour? But I came to this hour because of this. 12:28 Father,
glorify your name.
     Therefore, a voice came from heaven, saying, I both glorified it and will be glorifying it again.
     12:29
            Therefore, the crowd standing there and heard it, was saying, Thunder has happened.
     Others said, A messenger has spoken to him.
     12:30
            Jesus answered and said, This voice has not happened because of me, but because of you°.
12:31
       Now is the judgment of this world. Now the ruler of this world will be cast outside. 12:32 And if
I should be exalted out-of the earth, I will be attracting all peoples to myself. 12:33 (But he said this,
signifying by what sort of death he was about to die.)
     12:34
            The crowd answered him, We heard out-of the law that the Christ remains forever and how
do you say, It is essential for the Son of Man to be exalted? Who is this Son of Man?
    12:35
           Therefore, Jesus said to them, The light is still with you° for a little time. Walk° insofar as you°
have the light, in-order-that darkness might not overtake you° and he who is walking in the darkness
did not know where he is proceeding-away to. 12:36 Insofar as you° have the light, believe° in the light,
in-order-that you° might become sons of light.
    Jesus spoke these things and he went away and was hidden from them. 12:37 But though he himself
had done* so-many signs before them, they were not believing into him, 12:38 in-order-that the word
of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, ‘Lord, who believed our report? And to
whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?’ {Isa 53:1} 12:39 Because of this, they were not able to
believe, because Isaiah said again, 12:40 ‘He has blinded their eyes and he has hardened their heart;
in-order-that they should not see with their eyes and should perceive with their heart and should turn
and that* I might heal them.’{Isa 6:9, 10} 12:41 Isaiah said these things, when he saw his glory, and he
spoke concerning him. 12:42 Nevertheless even many out-of the rulers also believed in him, but they
were not confessing it because of the Pharisees, in-order-that they may not become expelled from

the synagogue; 12:43 for* they loved* the glory from men rather than the glory from God.
     12:44
            Now Jesus cried out and said, The one believing in me, is not believing in me, but in the one
who sent me. 12:45 And he who views me views the one who sent me. 12:46 I have come like a light
into the world, in-order-that everyone who believes in me may not remain in the darkness. 12:47 And
if anyone hears and does not believe my declarations, I do not judge him; for* I came, not in-order-
that I may judge the world, but in-order-that I may save the world. 12:48 He who is rejecting me, and
is not receiving my declarations has the one who judges him; the word which I spoke that will be
judging him in the last day. 12:49 Because I did not speak from myself, but the Father who sent me,
he himself gave me a commandment of what I should say and what I should speak. 12:50 And I know
that his commandment is everlasting life. Therefore, the things which I speak, just-as the Father has
said to me, so I speak to you.

     13:1
          Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that his hour has come in-order-that he
should go-away out-of this world to the Father; having loved* his own, the ones in the world, he
loved* them to the end. 13:2 And it happened during supper, the devil had already put into the heart
of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son in-order-that he should give him up. 13:3 Jesus, knowing that the Father
has given all the things into his hands and that he came forth from God and is proceeding-away to
God, 13:4 arises from supper and places his garments aside, and he took a towel and girded himself.
13:5
      Thereafter he puts water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe
them with the towel in which he was girding himself.
     13:6
          Therefore, he comes to Simon Peter and that man says to him, Lord, why are you washing my
feet?
     13:7
           Jesus answered and said to him, What I do* you do not know now, but you will know after
these things.
     13:8
           Peter says to him, never wash my feet forever.
     Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.
     13:9
           Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not only my feet, but also the hands and the head.
     13:10
            Jesus says to him, He who has been fully-washed does not need to wash himself, other than
the feet, but is entirely clean and you° are clean, but not all. 13:11 (For* he knew the one giving him
up.) Because of this, he said, You° are not all clean.
     13:12
           Therefore, when he washed their feet and took up his garments, and after having leaned-back
again, he said to them, Do you° know what I have done* for you°? 13:13 You° address me as the
Teacher and, the Lord, and you° say well; for* I am. 13:14 Therefore, if I, the Lord and the Teacher,
washed your° feet, you° also ought to wash one another’s feet. 13:15 For* I gave you° an example in-
order-that you° may also do* like I did* for you°. 13:16 Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, A
bondservant is not greater than his lord; nor is an apostle greater than he who sent him. 13:17 If you°
know these things, you° are fortunate if you° practice them.

            I do not speak concerning all of you°. I know whom I chose for myself, but in-order-that the

           Jesus having said these things, was disturbed in the spirit and testified and said, Assuredly,
assuredly, I am saying to you°, that one out-of you° will be giving me up.
    13:22
           Therefore, the disciples were looking toward one another, being perplexed concerning whom
he is speaking about. 13:23 But one of his disciples was reclining on Jesus’ bosom, the one whom
Jesus loved*. 13:24 Therefore, Simon Peter signals to this one to inquire, whoever it might be,
concerning whom he is speaking about. 13:25 But that man who had leaned upon Jesus’ chest so says
to him, Lord, who is it?
     13:26
           Jesus answers, It is that man to whom I dipped the morsel, and I will give it to him. And
having dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son. 13:27 And after the morsel, then
the Adversary entered into him. Therefore, Jesus says to that man, What you are doing*, do* quickly.
13:28
      (Now no one of the ones who are reclining at the table knew for what purpose he spoke this to
him. 13:29 For* some were thinking, since Judas had the money box, that Jesus is saying to him, Buy
what things we have need of *for the feast; or, in-order-that he should give something to the poor.)
13:30
      Therefore, having received the morsel, that man went forth immediately and it was night.
     13:31
           When he went forth, Jesus says, Now the Son of Man was glorified and God was glorified
in him; 13:32 If God was glorified in him, God will also be glorifying him in himself and immediately
he will be glorifying him. 13:33 Little-children, I am still with you° for a little while. You° will be
seeking me and just-as I said to the Jews, Where I am proceeding-away to, you° are not able to come.
Also now I am saying to you°, 13:34 I am giving to you° a new commandment, in-order-that you°
should love* one another; just-as I loved* you°, in-order-that you° also should love* one another. 13:35
Everyone will know that you° are my disciples in this, if you° have love* among one another.
     13:36
           Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where are you proceeding-away to?
     Jesus answered him, I am proceeding-away where you are not able to follow now, but you will
be following me later.
     13:37
           Peter says to him, Lord, why am I not able to follow you even now? I will lay down my life
on your behalf.

           Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life on my behalf? Assuredly, assuredly, I am
saying to you, The rooster should never crow, until which time you will be denying me three-times.

          But whenever the Helper* comes, whom I will be sending to you° from the Father, who is the
Spirit of the truth, who travels from the Father, that one will be testifying concerning me; 15:27 and
you° also testifying, because you° are with me from the beginning.

         I have spoken to you° these things in-order-that you° should not be offended. 16:2 They will be
doing* the expelling of you° from the synagogues. But the hour is coming, that* every person, the

these things to you°, because they did not know the Father, nor me. 16:4 But I have spoken these
things to you°, that* whenever the hour comes, you° may remember them, that I spoke them to you°.
Now I did not say these things to you° from the beginning, because I was with you°. 16:5 But now I am
proceeding-away to the one who sent me, and none out-of you° asks me, Where are you proceeding-
away to? 16:6 But because I have spoken these things to you°, sorrow has filled your° heart. 16:7 But I
tell you° the truth. It is advantageous for you° that* I should go away; for* if I do not go away, the
Helper* will not be coming to you°, but if I travel on, I will be sending him to you°. 16:8 And when he
has come, that one will be convicting the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and
concerning judgment. 16:9 Concerning sin, indeed, because they do not believe in me; 16:10 concerning
righteousness, because I am proceeding-away to my Father and you° view me no more; 16:11 and
concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged. 16:12 I still have many things
to say to you°, but you° are not able to bear them now. 16:13 But whenever that one, the Spirit of the
truth, comes, he will be guiding you° into all the truth; for* he will not be speaking from himself, but
as many things as he may hear, these he will be speaking and he will be reporting to you° the things
which are coming. 16:14 That one will be glorifying me, because he will receive from me and will be
proclaiming it to you°. 16:15 All things, as many things as the Father has are mine, because of this, I
said, He is receiving from me and will be proclaiming it to you°. 16:16 A little while and you° do not
view me, and again a little while and you° will see me, because I am proceeding-away to the Father.
    16:17
           Therefore, some out-of his disciples said to one another, What is this thing which he says to
us, A little while and you° do not view me, and again a little while and you° will see me. Also,
Because I am proceeding-away to the Father?
    16:18
           Therefore, they were saying, What is this thing which he says, A little while? We do not know
the meaning of what he says.
     16:19
            Therefore, Jesus knew that they were wishing to ask him, and he said to them, Are you°
debating with one another concerning this thing which I said, A little while and you° do not view me,
and again, A little while and you° will see me?
    16:20
           Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, that you° will be weeping and will be mourning,
but the world will rejoice. But you° will be sorrowful, but your° sorrow will happen leading you° to
joy. 16:21 A woman has sorrow whenever she bears a child, because her hour came. But whenever the
child is born, she remembers the affliction no more, because of the joy that a man was born into the
world. 16:22 And therefore, you° now indeed have sorrow, but I will see you° again and your° heart will
be rejoicing and no one takes your° joy away from you°. 16:23 And you° will not be asking me anything
in that day. Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you°, that as many things as you° would ask the
Father in my name, he will be giving them to you°. 16:24 Until now you° asked for nothing in my name.
Ask° and you° will receive, in-order-that your° joy may be fulfilled.
    16:25
           I have spoken these things to you° in metaphors, but the hour is coming, when I will no more
be speaking to you° in metaphors, but will be proclaiming to you° frankly concerning the Father. 16:26
You° will be asking in that day, in my name and I do not say to you° that I will request of the Father
concerning you°; 16:27 for* the Father himself loves you°, because you° have loved me and have
believed that I came forth from God. 16:28 I came forth from the Father and have come into the world;
again, I am leaving the world and I am traveling on to the Father.
     16:29
            Then his disciples say to him, Behold, now you speak frankly and are not speaking in a
metaphor. 16:30 Now we know that you know all things and do not have need that* anyone should ask
you. In this, we believe that you came forth from God.

           Jesus answered them, Do you° believe now? 16:32 Behold, the hour is coming and has now

yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 16:33 I have spoken to you° these things in-order-that

     17:1
          Jesus spoke these things, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come;
glorify your Son, in-order-that your Son may also glorify you; 17:2 just-as you gave him authority over
all flesh, in-order-that to all whom you have given him, he will be giving everlasting life to them.
17:3
      But this is everlasting life, in-order-that they may know you, the only true* God, and Jesus the
Christ, whom you sent. 17:4 I glorified you upon the earth. I completed the work which you have given
me, that* I should do*. 17:5 And now, Father, glorify me with yourself in the glory which I was holding
with you before the world is to be. 17:6 I manifested your name to the men whom you have given me
out-of the world. They were yours and you have given them to me, and they have kept your word.
17:7
      Now they have known that all things, as many things as you have given me, are from you, 17:8
because the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they themselves received
them and they truly knew that I came forth from you and they believed that you sent me.
     17:9
          I am requesting concerning them. I am not requesting concerning the world, but concerning
those whom you have given to me, because they are yours. 17:10 And all my things are yours and
yours are mine and I have been glorified in them. 17:11 And I am no more in the world and yet these
are in the world and I am coming to you.
     {Joh 17:11b-17:26 The Lord’s Prayer; no parallel.}
     Holy Father, keep them in your name whom you have given me, in-order-that they may be one,
just-as we are one. 17:12 When I was with them in the world, I was keeping them in your name whom
you have given me. I guarded them and not one out-of them perished, except the son of destruction;
in-order-that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 17:13 But now I am coming to you, and I speak these
things in the world, in-order-that they may have my joy, having been fulfilled in themselves. 17:14 I
have given them your word, and the world hated them, because they are not from the world, just-as
I am not from the world.
     17:15
           I am not requesting that* you should take them from the world, but in-order-that you should
keep them from the evil one. 17:16 They are not from the world just-as I am not from the world. 17:17
Make them holy in the truth; your word is truth. 17:18 Just-as you sent me forth into the world, I also
sent them forth into the world. 17:19 And I make myself holy on their behalf in-order-that they
themselves may also be made holy in truth.
     17:20
           I am not requesting concerning these only, but concerning the ones who also believe in me
through their word; 17:21 in-order-that they may all be one; just-as you, Father, are in me and I in you;
in-order-that they themselves may also be one in us; in-order-that the world may believe that you
sent me. 17:22 And the glory which you have given me I have given to them; in-order-that they may
be one, just-as we are one; 17:23 I am in them and you are in me, in-order-that they might be
completed into one and the world may know that you sent me and you loved* them, just-as you
loved* me. 17:24 Father, I wish that* they, whom you have given me, may also be with me where I am

Mountain of Olives, Late Thur. night.}
     18:1
          Jesus, having said these things, went forth together-with his disciples beyond-that area of the
winter-stream of Kidron valley {Or: of the Cedars}, where there was a garden, into which he and his
disciples entered.

           Now Judas (the one giving him up), also knew the place, because Jesus gathered there often
together with his disciples. 18:3 Therefore, having received the cohort {600 soldiers} and attendants
from the high-priests and Pharisees, Judas comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 18:4
Therefore, Jesus, knowing all the things which are coming upon him, went forth and said to them,
Whom are you° seeking?
     18:5
           They answered him, Jesus the Nazarene.
      Jesus says to them, I am he. And Judas, the one giving him up, stood also with them. 18:6
Therefore, as he said to them, I am he, they went behind {i.e., backed up} and fell to the level-ground.
18:7
      Therefore, again he asked them, Whom are you° seeking?
     And they said, Jesus the Nazarene.
     18:8
           Jesus answered, I said to you° that I am he; therefore, if you° seek me, allow° these men to
proceed-away. 18:9 (This happened in-order-that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, I did not
lose one out-of them of whom you have given me.) 18:10 Therefore, Simon Peter, having a sword,
dragged it out {i.e., unsheathed} and struck the bondservant of the high-priest and cut off his right ear.
Now the name of the bondservant was Malchus. 18:11 Therefore, Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword
into the sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, should I not drink it?

advantageous for one man to perish on behalf of the people.

           Now Simon Peter and the other disciple was following Jesus. Now that disciple was known
to the high-priest and entered in together-with Jesus into the courtyard of the high-priest; 18:16 but
Peter stood outside before the door. Therefore, the other disciple, who was known to the high-priest,
went forth and spoke to the doorkeeper and led in Peter.
     18:17
           Therefore, the maidservant who was the doorkeeper says to Peter, Are you also one out-of this
man’s disciples?
     That man says, I am not.

           Now the bondservants and the attendants stood there, having made* a coal-fire, because it was
cold, and they were warming themselves and Peter was standing and warming himself with them.
     {See Joh 18:12-14 above.}
    18:19
           Therefore, the high-priest asked Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his teaching.
18:20
      Jesus answered him, I spoke publicly to the world. I always taught in the synagogues and in the
temple, where the Jews are always coming together, and I spoke nothing in secret. 18:21 Why are you
asking me? Ask the ones who have heard me, what I spoke to them. Behold, these know what I said.
     18:22
           Now having said these things, one of the attendants standing beside him gave a slap on the
cheek to Jesus, and said, Why are you answering the high-priest so?
     18:23
            Jesus answered him, If I spoke evilly, testify concerning the evil, but if good, why are you
whipping me?

also one out-of his disciples?
     Therefore, that man denied and said, I am not.
    18:26
           One out-of the bondservants of the high-priest, being a relative of the one whose ear Peter cut
off, says, Did I not see you in the garden with him?

            Therefore, they lead Jesus from Caiaphas into the palace, and it was morning, and they
themselves did not enter into the palace in-order-that they might not be defiled, but in-order-that they
might eat the Passover. 18:29 Therefore, Pilate went forth to them and said, Which accusation are you°
bringing against this man?
    18:30
           They answered and said to him, If this one was not an evildoer, we would not have given him
up to you.
     18:31
           Therefore, Pilate said to them, You°, take° him and judge° him according-to your° law.
    Therefore, the Jews said to him, It is not legal for us to kill anyone. 18:32 (This happened in-order-
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke signifying by what sort of death he was
about to die.)
    18:33
           Therefore, Pilate entered again into the palace, and summoned Jesus and said to him, Are you
the King of the Jews?
     18:34
           Jesus answered him, Do you say this from yourself or did others say this to you concerning
me?
     18:35
           Pilate answered, I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the high-priests gave you up to
me. What have you done*?
    18:36
           Jesus answered, My kingdom is not from this world; if my kingdom was from this world, then
my attendants would fight in-order-that I might not be given up to the Jews, but now my kingdom

    18:37
          Therefore, Pilate said to him, Therefore, are you not a king?
   Jesus answered, You are saying that I am a king. I have been born to this end and I have come into
the world to this end, in-order-that I might testify to the truth. Everyone who is from the truth hears
my voice.
    18:38
          Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, he went forth again to the Jews and
says to them, I am finding no crime in him.

           But it is a custom with you°, that* I should release to you° one prisoner at the Passover;
therefore, do you° will that I should release to you° the King of the Jews?

          Therefore, they all cried-out again, saying, Not this one, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was
a robber.

    19:1
          Therefore, Pilate then took Jesus and scourged him. 19:2 And having braided a crown out-of
thorns, the soldiers placed it upon his head and dressed him in a purple garment; 19:3 and were saying,
Hail, King of the Jews! And they were giving slaps on the cheek to him.
    19:4
          Therefore, Pilate went outside again and says to them, Behold, I am leading him outside to
you°, in-order-that you° may know that I am finding no crime in him. 19:5 Therefore, Jesus came
outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple garment. And he says to them, Behold, the man!
    19:6
         Therefore, when the high-priests and the attendants saw him, they cried-out, saying, Crucify!
Crucify him!
    Pilate says to them, You°, take° him and crucify° him; for* I am finding no crime in him.
    19:7
         The Jews answered him, We have a law and according-to our law he ought to die, because he
        *
made himself the Son of God.
    19:8
         Therefore, when Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid; 19:9 and he entered into the palace
again and says to Jesus, Where are you from? But Jesus gave him no answer. 19:10 Therefore, Pilate
says to him, Why do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and
have authority to crucify you?
    19:11
          Jesus answered, You were holding no authority against me, unless it was given to you from
above. He who gives me to you has the greater sin because of this.
   19:12
          From this time, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews were crying out, saying, If you
release this one, you are no friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes* himself a king speaks against
Caesar. 19:13 Therefore, having heard this word, Pilate led Jesus outside and sat down upon the
judicial-seat in a place called* The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 19:14 But it was the
Preparation of the Passover and was approximately the sixth hour {i.e., Noon}.
    Now he says to the Jews, Behold, your° King!
    19:15
          But they cried-out, Take him, take him, crucify him!
    Pilate says to them, Will I crucify your° King?
    The high-priests answered, We have no king except Caesar. 19:16 Therefore, then he gave him up
to them in-order-that he might be crucified and they took Jesus and led him away.

          And he went forth, bearing his cross, to the place called*, The Place of a Skull, which is
called* in Hebrew, Golgotha,

          where they crucified him and two others with him, from here and then from here {i.e., one on
both sides} and Jesus in the middle. 19:19 But Pilate also wrote a title and placed it upon the cross. Now
it was written, Jesus the Nazarene, the King of the Jews. 19:20 Therefore, many of the Jews read this
title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew,
in Greek and in Latin.
    19:21
          Therefore, the high-priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the
Jews, but, That man said, I am King of the Jews.
    19:22
          Pilate answered, I have written what I have written.
    19:23
          Therefore, the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his garments and made* four parts,
a part to each soldier, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless from the top, because it was
entirely woven. 19:24 Therefore, they said to one another, We should not split-apart this tunic, but
should do a lot concerning it; whose it will be. This happened in-order-that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, which says, ‘They divided my garments for themselves and they cast a lot upon my
garment.’ {Psa 22.18} Therefore indeed, the soldiers did* these things. 19:25 But, his mother and his
mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary the Magdalene stood beside the cross of Jesus.
    19:26
          Therefore, after Jesus saw his mother and the disciple, whom he loved*, standing beside her,
he says to his mother, Woman, behold your son! 19:27 Thereafter he says to the disciple, Behold, your
mother! And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.
    {Mar 15:34-41 & Mat 27:46-56 & Luk 23:45-49 & Joh 19:28-30 around 5:00 PM.}
    19:28
          After this Jesus, having seen that all things have already been completed, in-order-that the
Scripture might be completed, which says, ‘I am thirsty.’ {Psa 69:21} 19:29 Therefore, a vessel was
laying full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge from the vinegar vessel and having placed it around
a hyssop, they brought it to his mouth. 19:30 Therefore, when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said,
It has been completed. And having bowed his head, he gave up the spirit.
    {Mar 15:42-47 & Mat 27:57-66 & Luk 23:50-56 & Joh 19:31-42 Before The Sabbath.}
    19:31
          Therefore, the Jews asked Pilate in-order-that the bodies should not remain upon the cross
on the Sabbath since it was the Preparation (for* the day of that Sabbath was a great day), that* their
legs might be fractured and that* they might be taken down. 19:32 Therefore, the soldiers came, and
indeed fractured the legs of the first and of the other one who was crucified together-with him, 19:33
but after they came upon Jesus, as they saw him the one who had already died, they did not fracture
his legs; 19:34 but one of the soldiers pierced his rib-cage with a spear and immediately blood and
water came forth. 19:35 And he who has seen, has testified and his testimony is true* and he knows that
he says true* things, in-order-that you° might believe. 19:36 For* these things happened in-order-that
the Scripture might be fulfilled, ‘A bone from him will not be crushed.’ {Exo 12:46 & Num 9:12 & Psa
34:20} 19:37 And again a different Scripture says, ‘They will be looking at the one whom they stabbed.’
{Zec 12:10}
    19:38
          After these things, Joseph from Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but having been hidden

because of his fear of the Jews, asked Pilate in-order-that he might take the body of Jesus and Pilate
permitted* him. Therefore, he came and took the body of Jesus. 19:39 Now Nicodemus also came, he
who came to Jesus the first time by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloe, approximately a
hundred pounds of it. 19:40 Therefore, they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen-strips with the
spices, just-as the custom of the Jews is to bury one. 19:41 Now in the place where he was crucified
there was a garden, and a new tomb was in the garden in which no one was yet placed. 19:42
Therefore, they placed Jesus there because of the Jews’ Preparation, and because the tomb was near.

    20:1
         Now on the first day of the week Mary the Magdalene comes in the morning, while being still
dark, to the tomb and sees the stone has been lifted away from the tomb. 20:2 Therefore, she runs and
comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They took away
the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they placed him.
    20:3
         Therefore, Peter went forth, and the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. 20:4
Now the two were running in unison and the other disciple ran quickly ahead of Peter and came to
the tomb first; 20:5 and having peered inside, he sees the linen-strips laying; nevertheless he did not
enter. 20:6 Therefore, Simon Peter comes, following him and entered into the tomb, and he views the
linen-strips laying, 20:7 and the handkerchief which was upon his head, was not laying with the linen-
strips, but has been entwined in one separate place. 20:8 Therefore, the other disciple also entered in
then, who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed. 20:9 (For* they did not yet know the
Scripture, that it is essential for him to rise* up from the dead.) 20:10 Therefore, the disciples went
away again to themselves.

    20:11
          But Mary stood outside before the tomb, weeping. Therefore, as she was weeping, she peered
into the tomb; 20:12 and she views two messengers in white sitting, one toward the head and one
toward the feet, where the body of Jesus was laying. 20:13 And those men say to her, Woman, why are
you weeping?
    She says to them, They took my Lord and I do not know where they placed him. 20:14 And having
said these things, she was turned toward the behind side of her and views Jesus standing and did not
know that it is Jesus.
    20:15
          Jesus says to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?
    That woman, thinking that one is the gardener, says to him, Lord, if you bore him away, tell me
where you placed him and I will take him.
    20:16
          Jesus says to her, Mary.
    That woman having turned around, says to him, Rabboni; which is spoken: Teacher.
    20:17
          Jesus says to her, Do not touch me; for* I have not yet ascended to my Father, but travel to
my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your° Father and my God and your°
God.
    20:18
          Mary the Magdalene comes, reporting to the disciples, that she has seen the Lord, and that
he had said these things to her.

   20:19
         Therefore, being evening in that day, the first day of the week, and after the doors had been
locked where the disciples were gathered because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the
middle, and says to them, Peace to you°. 20:20 And having said this, he showed to them the hands and
his rib-cage. Therefore, the disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.
   20:21
         Therefore, Jesus said to them again, Peace to you°; just-as the Father has sent me; I am also
sending you°. 20:22 And after having said this, he infused them and says to them, Receive° the Holy
Spirit. 20:23 If you° forgive sins of anyone, they are forgiven to them; if you° hold-fast sins of anyone,
those sins have been held-fast. {Mat 16:19, 18:18}
   20:24
         But Thomas, one out-of the twelve, who is called* Didymus {twin}, was not with them when
Jesus came. 20:25 Therefore, the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord.
   But he said to them, If I do not see the pattern of the nails in his hands and may put my finger into
the pattern of the nails and may put my hand into his rib-cage, I will never believe.
   {Joh 20:26-31 & 1Co 15:5 Sun. after resurrection.}
   20:26
         And after eight days his disciples were inside again and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the
doors having been locked and stood in the middle and said, Peace to you°. 20:27 Thereafter he says to
Thomas, Bring your finger here and behold the hands, and bring your hand here and put it into my
rib-cage and do not become unbelieving, but become believing.
   20:28
         And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God!
   20:29
         Jesus says to him, Because you have seen me, you have believed, but the fortunate ones have
not seen and yet have believed.
   20:30
         Therefore, Jesus indeed did* many other signs also in the sight of his disciples, which are not
written in this book; 20:31 but these have been written in-order-that you° may believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God, and in-order-that in believing you° may have life in his name.

   {Joh 21:1-25 Sea of Galilee; no parallel.}
   21:1
         After these things, Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples upon the sea of Tiberias,
and he appeared thus. 21:2 They were united-together: Simon Peter and Thomas called* Didymus and
Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others out-of his disciples. 21:3
Simon Peter says to them, I am proceeding-away to fish.
    They say to him, We are also coming together-with you. They went forth and immediately
stepped into the ship, and they snagged nothing in the net in that night.
   21:4
        Now after it already became morning, Jesus stood at the beach; nevertheless the disciples did
not know that it is Jesus. 21:5 Therefore, Jesus says to them, Children, do you° have any snacks?
   They answered him, No.
   21:6
         But he said to them, Cast° the net toward the right parts of the ship and you° will find some.
Therefore, they cast it, and they were not strong-enough to drag it into the ship away from the
multitude of fish.
   21:7
        Therefore, that disciple whom Jesus loved* says to Peter, It is the Lord. Therefore, Simon Peter


184                                                                                                       mlvbible.com
having heard, It is the Lord; he girded the outer clothing upon himself (for* he was naked {Or: half-
dressed}) and cast himself into the sea. 21:8 But the other disciples came in the small-boat (for* they
were not far from the land, but approximately two hundred cubits away from it), dragging the net full
of fish. 21:9 Therefore, as they stepped away to the land, they see a coal-fire laying there and a little-
fish laying upon it and bread.
    21:10
           Jesus says to them, Bring° some from the little-fish which you° have now snagged in the net.
21:11
      Simon Peter went-up and dragged the net upon the land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-
three. And being so-many, yet the net was not split-apart. 21:12 Jesus says to them, Come-here°. Have°
a meal.
    But none of the disciples were daring to probe him, Who are you (knowing that it was the Lord)?
21:13
      Therefore, Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them and the little-fish likewise. 21:14
This is already the third-time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after having been raised
from the dead.
     {Joh 21:15, 16, 17 ‘Love*’ (with an asterisk) means ‘all giving love.’ ‘Love’ (without an asterisk) means ‘a love of
a friend.’ The Greeks defined the various kinds of love by different words. Jesus is asking ‘Peter’ are you willing to die
for me.}
     21:15
           Therefore, when they had a meal, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you
       *
love me more-than these?
     He says to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.
     He says to him, Feed my lambs.
     21:16
           He says to him again a second-time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love* me?
     He says to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.
     He says to him, Shepherd my sheep.
     21:17
           He says to him the third-time, Simon, son of Jonah, Do you love me?
    Peter was sorrowful because he said to him the third-time, Do you love me like a friend? And he
said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you like a friend.
    Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep. 21:18 Assuredly, assuredly, I am saying to you, When you were
younger, you were girding yourself and were walking where you were wishing. But whenever you
are elderly, you will stretch out your hands and another will gird you and will be carrying you where
you do not wish. 21:19 Now he spoke this signifying by what sort of death he will be glorifying God.
And having said this, he says to him, Follow me.
     21:20
            But Peter, having turned again, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved* following; who also
leaned-back upon his chest at the supper and who had said, Lord, who is he who is giving you up?
21:21
      Peter having seen this one says to Jesus, Lord and what about this one?
    21:22
           Jesus says to him, If I will for him to abide until I come, what is that to you? You, follow me!
     21:23
           Therefore, this speech went forth to the brethren, that, that disciple does not die. And yet
Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, If I will for him to remain until I come, what is that
to you?
     21:24
           This is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things and wrote these things and we
know that his testimony is true*.
    21:25
           Now there are also many other things testifying to how-much Jesus did*, which if they should
be written every one, I assume that not even the world itself is able to make room for the books

                Examples of those who are saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 10:34-48; 16:13-15;
            16:25-34; 18:8a; 18:8b; 19:1-7; Saul/Apostle Paul: 9:17-18, -16, 26:12-18 are in chart below and these are great
            examples of Jesus’ ‘great commission’ in action (harmonized on page 7).
                Others are possibly noted by Luke’s term ‘believed’ but not all details were given since the Greek word for ‘believed’
            carries with it ‘obedience’ and continued action: Acts 4:1-4; 11:21 (note ‘conversion’ is the Greek noun form of
            ‘turned’), 13:12; 13:48; 14:1 & 2 (note the contrast of believed vs. disobedient) then later 14:21-23 (note they were called
            disciples, Mat 28:19, ‘in the faith’, elders, every congregation); 17:12-14; 17:32-34; 19:15-20. Now since Crispus listed
            below was immersed as recorded in 1Co 1:14, this lets us know that even when all the elements of conversion aren’t
            specifically listed, it is still safe to assume they all occurred.
                The Bible is not written in exhaustive encyclopedia form. God only told us what we need to know and practice if we
            love him, John 14:15. The biggest lies ever told to a Christian is ‘The Bible doesn’t say not to...’ or that ‘It is okay to
            substitute’ and the O.T. is binding in any way on us Christians.

                The book of Acts, or the Book of Conversions, is a history of the establishment of various congregations and the
            expansion of Christianity. It is actually a continuation of the gospel of Luke, written by the same author to the same
            audience. A good outline for the whole book is given by Jesus in 1:8: ‘you will be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem
            (chapters 1-6) and in all Judea and Samaria (chapter 8), and to the outermost parts of the earth (9-28).’
                These Roman emperors reigned during this period were as follows: Tiberius (14-37 A.D.), Caligula (37-41), Claudius
            (41-54), and Nero (54-68).
                This book covers about 30 years.
                In this book are the only examples in the entire New Testament of how people are saved from their sins following the
            death of Christ Jesus; great examples of the ‘Great Commission’ in action. In fact, the question, ‘what will we do?’ is
            asked and answered multiple times in this book. The Jews (Acts 2), the Samaritans (Acts 8), the Gentiles (Acts 10), the
            Philippian jailer (Acts 16), and Saul (Acts 9,22, 26) were taught about Christ Jesus, and salvation was offered to them
            all in the same way. Saul (later, apostle Paul), even though called from heaven, was even told what was essential to do


(Acts 22:16).
    The last half of the book focuses mainly on the travels of the apostle Paul, who went throughout the Roman Empire
teaching people what to do to be saved. During his travels, many of the New Testament letters were written to various
congregations.
    Look closely in this book to see what commands are from God, and put them to the test of men in regards to salvation
and how Jesus built his congregation of believers.}}

         O Theophilus, I indeed made* the first account concerning all things which Jesus began both
to do* and to teach, 1:2 till the day of which he was received up, having commanded through the Holy
Spirit to the apostles whom he chose.

suffered on the cross, being seen by them throughout forty days and saying the things concerning the
kingdom of God. 1:4 And, assembling together-with them, he commanded them not to depart from
Jerusalem, but to remain until the promise of the Father, Which (he said), You° have heard from me;
1:5
    because John indeed immersed* in water, but you° will be immersed* in the Holy Spirit after not
these many days {i.e., a few days}.

         Therefore indeed, after they came together, they were asking him, saying, Lord, Are you are
never* restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time, then?
    1:7
         Now he said to them, It is not yours° to know times or seasons, which the Father placed in his
own authority. 1:8 But you° will be receiving power after the Holy Spirit has come upon you°, you°
will be witnesses to me, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the outermost parts
of the earth.

         And having said these things, and while looking at him, he was lifted up, and a cloud received
him away from their staring eyes. 1:10 And as they were staring at his traveling on into heaven, and
behold, two men stood beside them in white apparel; 1:11 who also said, Men, Galileans! Why are
you° standing here, looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was received up from you° into heaven will
be coming back thus in the manner you° saw him traveling on into heaven. {Acts 1:11 & Mat 24:27,

they entered, they went-up into the upstairs-room; where they were remaining: both Peter and John

         And Peter stood up in these days in the midst of the disciples ( a crowd of names {i.e., people}
were in the same place, approximately a hundred and twenty) and said, 1:16 Men, brethren, it was
essential for this Scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit said beforehand through the mouth
of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to the ones who took Jesus, 1:17 because he was
being numbered together-with us and was allotted the inheritance of this service.

          (Therefore indeed, this one procured a parcel of ground from the reward of his
unrighteousness, and he happened to fall-flat and ruptured in the middle and all his bowels were
poured out. 1:19 And it became known to all the ones dwelling in Jerusalem; so-then in their own
language this place is called Akeldama, that is, The Place of Blood.) 1:20 For* it has been written in
the book of Psalms, ‘Let his habitation become desolate and do not let the one be dwelling in it’ {Psa
69:25} and, ‘May a different one take his overseership.’ {Psa 109:8} 1:21 Therefore, it is essential, of the
ones who went together-with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus entered in and went forth among
us, 1:22 having begun from the immersion* of John, to the day from which he was received up from
us; one of these is to become a witness together-with us of his resurrection. 1:23 And they stood up
two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus and Matthias. 1:24 And having prayed, they
said, You Lord, knower of the hearts of all, show which one out-of these two you have chosen for
yourself 1:25 to receive the inheritance of this service and apostleship from which Judas transgressed,
so as to travel on to his own place. 1:26 And they gave them their lots and the lot fell upon Matthias,
and he was enumerated together with the eleven apostles.

     But this is what has been spoken through the prophet Joel, 2:17 God says, ‘And it will be in the last
days, I will pour out from My Spirit upon all flesh and your° sons and your° daughters will prophesy
and your° young-men will see visions and your° elderly-men will be dreaming dreams. 2:18 For-sure,
I will pour out from my Spirit upon my male bondservants and upon my female bondservants in
those days, and they will prophesy. 2:19 And I will be giving you° wonders in the heaven above and
signs upon the earth below; blood and fire and vapor of smoke. 2:20 The sun will be turned into
darkness and the moon into blood, before the great and illustrious day of the Lord is to come. 2:21 And
it will be: everyone, whoever is calling upon the name of the Lord, will be saved.’ {Joel 2:28-32}
     2:22
          Men, Israelites! Hear° these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man from God, having been shown
to you° by miracles and wonders and signs which God did* through him in your° midst, just-as you°
yourselves also know; 2:23 this one being given up by what had been determined in the plan and
foreknowledge of God; you° assassinated him, having taken him and having fastened him to a cross
through lawless hands; 2:24 whom God raised* up, having loosed the travails of death, insomuch as
it was not possible for him to be held-fast by it. 2:25 For* David says in regard to him, ‘I was
foreseeing the Lord always in my sight, because he is at my right hand, in-order-that I might not be
shaken. 2:26 Because of this, my heart was joyous and my tongue was glad. Now my flesh will also
still reside in hope; 2:27 because you will not forsake my soul to Hades, neither will you give your
Holy One to see decay. 2:28 You made known to me the ways of life. You will fill me from joy with
your countenance.’ {Psa 16:8-11} 2:29 Men, brethren, it is legal for me to speak with boldness {Or:
frankly} to you° concerning the patriarch David, that he both died* and was buried and his tomb is
with* us till this day. 2:30 Therefore, being* a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath
to him, that from the fruit of his loin, to raise* up the Christ according-to the flesh to sit upon his
throne. {Psa 89:3-4, 132:11} 2:31 Having foreseen this, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the
Christ, that his soul was not left to Hades, nor did his flesh see decay. {Psa 16:10} 2:32 This Jesus, God
raised* up, of whom we are all witnesses. 2:33 Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of
God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this, which
you° are seeing and hearing now. 2:34 For* David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,
‘The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, 2:35 until I should place your enemies as the
footstool of your feet.’ {Psa 110:1} 2:36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel know with certainty, that

Christ into the forgiveness of your° sins, and you° will be receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit. {F} 2:39
For* the promise is to you° and to your° children and to all the ones at afar off, as many as the Lord
our God would call. 2:40 And he was thoroughly testifying and encouraging them with many other
words, saying, Save° yourselves from this crooked generation. 2:41 Therefore indeed, they, who gladly
accepted his word, were immersed*, and approximately three thousand souls were added in the same
day. 2:42 Now they were persevering in the apostles’ teaching and in the fellowship and in the
breaking of the bread and in the prayers.
    {Acts 2:38 has been a constant ‘revolving door’ as: ‘*for,’ ‘into,’ ‘to/toward,’ ‘leading to,’ ‘leading toward,’ ‘to obtain’
have all been used in the MLV and not everyone is ever satisfied. But they only discuss Acts 2:38, not the other four
places this same Greek construction is in the Greek Bible. People who are defending Acts 2:38 keep wanting something
besides ‘for.’ Which was never the translation in the MLV; see list above. ‘For’ in English can mean ‘because’ but this
word is ‘eis’ (G1519). No translation has ever used ‘because’ or ‘because of’ in Acts 2:38, including the ones made by
the denominations who want it there (sadly though some had to put it in as a footnote, ironically some of their older
translations used ‘leading to/toward’). Thayer used “to obtain.” This misunderstanding is also due to the fact the MLV
is the only English translation that corrected all the ‘for’ words by translating them to their more accurate English word.
Other than ‘for*,’ all ‘for’ words in the MLV which literally meant ‘because’ are translated as such.
    The second part could possibly be translated ‘you° will receive the Holy Spirit’s gift.’
    We are not sorry that the theologians need to learn the Bible!}
     2:43
          Now fear became in every soul and many wonders and signs were happening through the
apostles. 2:44 But all who believe were in the same mind and had all things common. 2:45 They were
selling* their properties and possessions and dividing them to all, if, insomuch as, anyone was having
a need. 2:46 And persevering every day, united in the temple and breaking bread in every house, they
were taking their nourishment in gladness and simplicity of heart, 2:47 praising God, and having favor
toward the whole people. Now the Lord was adding to the congregation* of believers the ones who
are saved every day.

there, whom they were laying every day at the door of the temple which is called* Beautiful, to ask
charity from the ones who travel into the temple, 3:3 who having seen Peter and John being about to

           Now the lame man who was healed, was holding-fast to Peter and John, then all the people
ran together to them upon the porch which is called Solomon’s utterly amazed. 3:12 Now having seen
them, Peter answered to the people, Men, Israelites! Why are you° marveling over this one? Or why
are you° staring at us, as though by our own power or devoutness we have made* him able to walk?
3:13
     The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his young-

restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of all his holy prophets from the age
past. 3:22 For* Moses indeed said to the fathers, The Lord our God will raise* up for you° a prophet
out-of your° brethren, like me. You° will be listening to him according-to all things, as many things

Sadducees stood by them, 4:2 being pained, because they teach the people and proclaim the
resurrection of the dead in Jesus. 4:3 And they put hands upon them and they themselves placed them
in jail to the next-day; for* it was already dusk. 4:4 But many of the ones who heard the word believed,

Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of the Nazarenes, whom you° crucified, whom God raised up

        Now viewing the boldness of Peter and John, they were marveling, having comprehended that
they are illiterate and unskilled men. And they were recognizing them, that they had been together-
with Jesus. 4:14 But seeing the man who had been healed, standing together-with them, they had
nothing to speak against it. 4:15 But having commanded them to go outside the council, they were
pondering these things with one another, 4:16 saying, What will we do* to these men? For* that indeed
a known sign has happened through them and apparent to all the ones dwelling in Jerusalem, and
we are not able to deny it. 4:17 But in-order-that it should not circulate more-than this into the people,
we will threaten them with more threatening, to no longer speak to any men in this name. 4:18 And
having called them back, they commanded them not to speak nor teach entirely upon the name of
Jesus.
   4:19
        But Peter and John answered and said to them, Judge° for yourselves if it is righteous in God’s
sight to listen to words from you° rather than from God. 4:20 For* we are unable to not speak what we
saw and heard. 4:21 But having additionally threatened them, they released them, finding nothing as
to how they will punish them, because of the people, because all were glorifying God over what has
happened. 4:22 For* the man was more-than forty years old, upon whom this sign of healing had
happened.
   4:23
        Now having been released, they came to their own brethren and reported how-much the high-
priests and the elders had said to them. 4:24 Now they, having heard it, lifted up their voice to God
united and said, Master, you are the God who made* the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the
things in them; 4:25 who through the mouth of your young-servant David, said, ‘Why did the Gentiles
rage and the peoples meditate on empty things? 4:26 The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers
were gathered in the same place, against the Lord and against his Christ.’ {Psa 2:1-2} 4:27 For* against
truth, against your holy young-servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate,
together-with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together 4:28 to do* as many things
as your hand and your council determined beforehand to happen. 4:29 And hereafter, Lord, look upon
their threats and give to your bondservants to speak your word with all boldness, 4:30 for you to
stretch out in your hand *for healing, and signs and wonders to happen through the name of your holy
young-servant Jesus. 4:31 And having besought the Lord, the place was shaken in which they were
gathered together, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they were speaking the word of
God with boldness.

        Now the multitude of the ones who believed were of one heart and soul and not one of them
said that anything of his own possessions is for themselves, but all things were common to them. 4:33
And the apostles were giving their testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power

pilfered part for themselves from the price, his wife also having been conscious of it, and brought
a certain part, placed it beside the apostles’ feet. 5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why has the Adversary
filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and for you to pilfer part for yourself from the price of the
parcel of ground? 5:4 While it is remaining unsold, was it not remaining yours? And having been
sold*, was* it not still in your authority? Why did you purpose this matter in your heart? You did not
lie to men, but to God. 5:5 But Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired, and great fear
came* upon all the ones hearing these things. 5:6 Now after the younger-men stood up, they
enshrouded him and carried him out and buried him.

         Now it happened after an interval of approximately three hours, his wife also entered, not
knowing what has happened. 5:8 But Peter answered her, Tell me if you° were given so-much for the
parcel of ground?
    And she said, Yes, for so-much.

        But Peter said to her, Why is it that it was agreed together by you° to test the Spirit of the Lord?
Behold, the feet of the ones who buried your husband are at the door and they will be carrying you
out. 5:10 Now she fell down instantly beside his feet and expired and the young-men entered and
found her dead and they carried her out and buried her with her husband. 5:11 And great fear came*
upon the whole congregation* and upon all the ones hearing these things.

         Now through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were happening among the
people, and they were all united at Solomon’s porch. 5:13 But no one of the rest was daring to be
joined to them, but the people were applauding them; 5:14 and more believers, multitudes of both men
and women, were adding themselves to the Lord. 5:15 So-then they started to carry out the sick in the
streets, to lay them upon cots and pallets in-order-that, while Peter comes by, if-only the shadow of
him might overshadow anyone of them. 5:16 Now the multitude was also coming together from the
cities in and around Jerusalem, carrying sick people, and those being troubled by unclean spirits; and
who were all being healed.

apostles and placed them in the public jail. 5:19 But a messenger of the Lord through the night, opened

they reported, 5:23 saying, We indeed found the prison, having been locked with* all the security
intact, and the guards standing before the doors. But having opened it, we found no one inside. 5:24
Now as both the magistrate of the temple and the priest and the high-priests heard these words, they
were perplexed concerning them as to why this would have happened.

           But someone came*, and reported to them, Behold, the men, whom you° placed in the prison

him upon a tree. 5:31 This Jesus is the Author and Savior who God exalted to his right hand, to give
repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 5:32 And we are witnesses of these words, and so is the
Holy Spirit, whom God gave to the ones obeying him.
     5:33
           But hearing this, they were being infuriated and were planning to assassinate them. 5:34 But a
certain one in the council stood up there, a Pharisee, Gamaliel by name, a teacher of the law, honored
by all the people, and he commanded them to make* the apostles wait outside for a certain bit of time.
5:35
     And he said to them, Men, Israelites! Take-heed° to yourselves what you° are about to do* against
these men. 5:36 For* before these days rose* up Theudas, saying that he himself is someone, who was
assassinated; to whom a number of men were called, approximately four hundred; and all, as many
as were obeying him were disbanded and came* to nothing. 5:37 After this one rose* up Judas, a
Galilean, in the days of the census and a considerable number of people withdrew after him. He also
perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered. 5:38 And hereafter I say to you°,
Withdraw° from these men and permit° them to continue, because if the plan or this work is from
men, it will be torn-down; 5:39 but if it is from God, you° are not able to tear-down it; lest you° might
be found even to be quarreling against God.
     5:40
           Now they were persuaded by him, and having called the apostles to them, they whipped them,
and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus and released them. 5:41 Therefore indeed, they
were traveling away from the face of the council, rejoicing that they were deemed worthy to be
dishonored on behalf of the name of Jesus. 5:42 And they were not ceasing, teaching and proclaiming
the good-news: Jesus is the Christ, every day both in the temple and in every house.

seven men, who are well testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we might
designate over this need. 6:4 But we will be persevering in prayer and in the service of the word. 6:5
And the speech pleased everyone of the multitude and they themselves chose Stephen, a man full
of faith and of the Holy Spirit and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and
Nicolaus a Jewish-convert from Antioch; 6:6 whom they stood in the sight of the apostles and having
prayed, they laid their hands upon them.

debating together-with Stephen. 6:10 And they were not strong-enough to stand against the wisdom

speak blasphemous declarations at Moses and God. 6:12 And they agitated the people and the elders

     7:2
           Now he said, Men, brethren and fathers, listen°: the God of glory was seen by our father
Abraham, while being in Mesopotamia, before he himself was to dwell in Haran, 7:3 and said to him,
Come out-of your land and from your relatives and come-here into the land whatever I will be
showing you. {Gen 12:1,2,4} 7:4 Then after he went forth out-of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in
Haran and after his father died, God exiled him from there into this land in which you° are now
dwelling. {Gen 13:14-18} 7:5 And he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a step of his foot, and he
promised to give it to him and to his seed after him *for his territory, even not being a child yet to
him. {Gen 15:13, 14} 7:6 Now God spoke thus: That his seed will be a foreigner in an alien land, and
they will enslave it and will be mistreating them four hundred years. 7:7 And God said, I will be
judging the nation to which they would be enslaved, and they will be coming forth and will be
giving-divine-service to me in this place after these things. {Gen 17:10-14} 7:8 And he gave him the
covenant* of circumcision and so he fathered Isaac and he circumcised him on the eighth day, and
to Isaac was born Jacob and to Jacob the twelve patriarchs. {Gen 21:4, 25:20-26, 46:8-26} 7:9 And the
patriarchs, having been jealous of Joseph, gave him into Egypt. And God was with him, 7:10 and
liberated him from all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom in front of Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, who designated him leader over Egypt and his whole house. {Gen 37:23-25, 36} 7:11 Now a

fathers out the first time. {Gen 42:1, 2} 7:13 And Joseph was recognized at the second meeting by his
brethren, and Joseph’s race became apparent to the Pharaoh. {Gen 43:2, 45:16} 7:14 But Joseph himself,
having sent them, called Jacob, his father, and all the relatives, in souls, seventy-five. 7:15 Now Jacob
went-down into Egypt and died*, he himself and our fathers; {Exodus 1:1-6} 7:16 and were transferred
to Shechem and were placed in the tomb which Abraham purchased from set price of silver from the
sons of Hamor in Shechem. {Jos 24:32} 7:17 Now just-as the time of the promise was drawing near,
which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and were multiplied in Egypt, 7:18 till a different
king rose* up over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. {Exodus 1:7, 8} 7:19 This one, having dealt craftily
with our race, mistreated our fathers, to make* them place their babies outside in the elements, *that*
they should not live. {Exo 2:2} 7:20 In which season, Moses was born and was handsome to God, and
he was reared three months in his father’s house. {Exodus 1:7, 8, 10-22, 2:1-10} 7:21 Now after he was
placed outside in the elements, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and reared him *for a son for herself.
     7:22
          Now Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and
in works. 7:23 Now as the time of forty years was being fulfilled to him, it came-up upon his heart to
visit his brethren, the sons of Israel. 7:24 And having seen a certain one of them being hurt, he
retaliated and did* the avenging for the one being subjugated, and struck the Egyptian; {Exo 2:11}
7:25
      and he was supposing that his brethren are to understand that God is giving them salvation
through his hand. But they did not understand. 7:26 And he was seen the next day by them, those who
were quarreling and drove them to make peace, having said, Men, you° are brethren! Why are you°
wronging one another? {Exo 2:13,14} 7:27 But the one hurting the neighbor shoved him away and said,
Who designated you a ruler and a justice over us? 7:28 You do not wish to assassinate me in the
manner which you assassinated the Egyptian yesterday, do you?
     7:29
          But at this speech, Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he fathered
two sons. {Exo 18:3} 7:30 And after forty years were fulfilled, a messenger of the Lord was seen by him
in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of a fiery bush. {Exo 3:6} 7:31 But after Moses saw it, he
was marveling at the vision of it. And while coming near to consider what it was, a voice of the Lord
came* to him, 7:32 I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the
God of Jacob. {Exo 3:6} And the trembling Moses came*, and was not daring to consider what it was.
7:33
      Now the Lord said to him, Loose the shoes from your feet; for* the place in which you are
standing is holy land. 7:34 Having seen, I saw the mistreatment of my people who were in Egypt and
heard their groaning and I descended to liberate them. And now come-here, I will be sending you
into Egypt. {Exo 3:1-10} 7:35 This Moses whom they denied, having said, Who designated you a ruler
and a justice? God sent this one as a ruler and a redeemer by the hand of the messenger who was
seen by him in the bush. {Exo 14:21, 12:41, 15:23, 16:1-36} 7:36 This one led them out, having done*
wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. 7:37
This is the Moses, the one having said to the sons of Israel, The Lord our God will raise* up to you°
a prophet out-of your° brethren, like me. {Deu 18:15} 7:38 This is he who came* to be in the
congregation* in the wilderness with the messenger, the one speaking to him on Mount Sinai and
from our fathers. This is he who accepted the living word to give to us; {Exo 19:3, 20:1-24:18} 7:39 to
whom our fathers willed not to become obedient*, but shoved God away from themselves and turned
themselves back toward Egypt in their heart, 7:40 having said to Aaron, Make* us gods which will
travel before us. For* this Moses, who led us forth out-of the land of Egypt, we do not know what
has happened to him. {Exo 32:1-6} 7:41 And they made* a calf in those days and brought* a sacrifice to

prophets, ‘You° did not offer slaughtered beasts and sacrifices to me for forty years in the wilderness,
O house of Israel, did you°? 7:43 And you° took up the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of the god
Remphan, the patterns which you° made* to worship them and I will be exiling you° past Babylon.’
{Amos 5:25-27} 7:44 The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, just-as he,
after he speaks with Moses, commanded him to make* it according-to the pattern which he had seen.
{Exo 25:9,40, 26:30} 7:45 Which also our fathers, having accepted in succession, brought* in with Joshua,
in the territory of the nations, which God shoved out away from the face of our fathers, until the days
of David. {Jos 3:14, 18:1} 7:46 David, who found favor in God’s sight, and asked to find a tabernacle
for the God of Jacob. {2Sa 7:2, 2Ch 17:1-4} 7:47 But Solomon built him a house. {1Ki 8:1-66, 2Ch 5:1} 7:48

          Now hearing these things, they were being infuriated in their hearts and they were gnashing
their teeth at him. 7:55 But possessing the fullness of the Holy Spirit, he stared into heaven and saw
the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, 7:56 and said, Behold, I am viewing the
heavens which have been opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God. 7:57 But
having cried out in a loud voice, they held together their ears, and united, rushed upon him. 7:58 And
having cast him outside the city, they were stoning him. And the witnesses placed their garments
beside the feet of a young-man called Saul. 7:59 And they were stoning Stephen, who was calling upon
the Lord, and saying, Lord Jesus, accept my spirit. 7:60 Now having placed his knees down, he cried
out with a loud voice, Lord, do not weigh this, their sin, to them. And having said this, he fell-asleep.

the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be someone great. 8:10 To whom they were taking-heed, from
the little to the great, saying, This one is the power of God, the Great. 8:11 Now they were taking-heed
to him because he has astonished them with his various magics for a considerable time. 8:12 But when
they believed Philip proclaiming the good-news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of
Jesus Christ, they were being immersed*, both men and women. 8:13 Now Simon himself also
believed and was immersed*, and was persevering with Philip. And viewing signs and miracles

he was reading was this: ‘He was led like a sheep at the slaughter, and like a lamb in front of the one
shearing him is voiceless, thus he does not open his mouth. 8:33 His judgment was taken away in his
humbleness. But who will be describing his generation? Because his life is taken from the earth.’ {Isa

is the prophet speaking about in this? Is he speaking concerning himself or concerning some other
person?
    8:35
          Now Philip opened his mouth and having begun from this Scripture, proclaimed the good-
news of Jesus to him. 8:36 Now as they were traveling down the road, they came upon some water,
and the eunuch says, Behold, here is water; what is preventing me now, to be immersed*? {T} 8:37 Now
Philip said, If you believe from your whole heart, it is legal.
    But he answered and said I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.

Jesus is the Christ.
     9:23
          Now as a considerable number of days were being fulfilled, the Jews planned together to
assassinate him; 9:24 but their pact was known to Saul. And they were guarding the gates both day and
night *that they might assassinate him. 9:25 But the disciples took him by night and dropped him down
through the wall, having lowered him in a basket.

          Now after Saul came* into Jerusalem, he was attempting to be joined to the disciples, and all
were fearing him, not believing that he is a disciple. 9:27 But Barnabas grabbed him and led him to
the apostles, and described to them how he saw the Lord on the road and that he spoke to him and
how in Damascus he spoke boldly in the name of Jesus. 9:28 And as he was traveling into Jerusalem
with them, and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus. 9:29 And he both was speaking and was
debating together-with the Grecian Jews, but they were undertaking the task to assassinate him.

Samaria had peace. They were being multiplied, being built up, and having conducted-themselves

     {40 AD. Lydda & Joppa. Herod Antipas banished.}
     9:32
           Now Peter, going through all the regions, happened to also come down to the holy-ones, the
ones dwelling at Lydda. 9:33 Now he found a certain paralyzed man there, Aeneas by name, who was
laying in his pallet from eight years ago. 9:34 And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals
you. Stand up and spread your bed for yourself. And immediately he stood up. 9:35 And all dwelling
at Lydda, and Sharon, who saw him, turned over to the Lord.
     9:36
           Now there was a certain disciple in Joppa, Tabitha by name, which by translation, is called*
Dorcas. This one was full of good works and of various charities, which she was doing*. 9:37 Now
she happened to die in those days, having been sick. Now having fully-washed her, they placed her
in an upstairs-room. 9:38 Now Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter is in it, sent
for him, encouraging him not to hesitate to come to them. 9:39 Now having stood up, Peter went
together-with them, those who came*, and they led him into the upstairs-room. And all the widows
presented to him, weeping and showing the tunics and garments; as many as Dorcas was making*,
while being with them. 9:40 But after Peter had cast them all outside; having placed his knees down,
he prayed. And having turned again toward the body, he said, Tabitha, rise* up. And she opened her
eyes, and after she saw Peter, she sat up. 9:41 Now he gave her his hand and stood her up. And having
summoned the holy-ones and widows, he presented her as living. 9:42 Now it became known
throughout the whole of Joppa and many believed upon the Lord. 9:43 Now he happened for him to
remain a considerable number of days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.

     {40 AD. Caesarea.}
     10:1
          Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion out-of what is called
the Italian cohort {600 soldiers}, 10:2 a devout man, who fears God together-with all his house and
doing* many charities for the people and always beseeching God. 10:3 He saw openly in a vision, at
approximately the ninth hour {i.e., 3:00 PM} of the day, a messenger of God who entered to him and
said to him, Cornelius.
     10:4
           But having stared at him and having become fearful, said, What is it, Lord?
     But he said to him, Your prayers and your many charities went-up *for a memorial in God’s sight.
10:5
     And now send men to Joppa and send for Simon, who is surnamed Peter. 10:6 This one is lodged
with a certain Simon, a tanner, in which his house is beside the sea. {T} He will tell you something that
is essential for you to do. 10:7 Now as the messenger, the one who had been speaking to Cornelius,
went away, he summoned two of his domestic servants and a devout soldier of the ones who are
persevering with him; 10:8 and having described all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
     {40 AD. Joppa.}
     10:9
           Now on the next-day, while those men are traveling and drawing near to the city, Peter went-

up upon the housetop to pray, around the sixth hour {i.e., Noon}. 10:10 Now he became very hungry and
was wishing to taste food, but while those men are preparing the food, a trance fell upon him. 10:11
And he views the heaven having opened and a certain vessel descending over him, like a great sheet
having been bound and being dropped down by four edges upon the earth; 10:12 in which were* all
kinds of four-footed mammals and beasts and reptiles of the earth and birds of the heaven. 10:13 And
a voice came* to him, Sacrifice and eat after having stood up Peter.
    10:14
          But Peter said, Not-so, Lord, because I never ate anything, common or unclean.
    10:15
           And a voice came to him again the second-time, What God cleansed, you, do not make
common. 10:16 But this happened upon three-times and again the vessel was received up into heaven.
    10:17
          Now as Peter was perplexed in himself whatever the vision which he saw might be meaning.
And behold, the men, the ones who have been sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s
house, stood at the gate, 10:18 and having summoned them, they were inquiring if Simon, who is
surnamed Peter, is lodged here.
    10:19
          But while Peter is contemplating concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men
are seeking you. 10:20 But after having stood up, go-down and travel together-with them, judging
nothing, because I have sent them.
    10:21
          Now Peter went-down to the men {T} who were sent from Cornelius to him and said, Behold,
I am he whom you° are seeking. What is the cause through which you° are here?
    10:22
          Now they said, Cornelius a centurion, a righteous man and fearing God, being well testified
of by the whole nation of the Jews, was divinely-warned by a holy messenger to send for you to come
to his house and to hear words from you. 10:23 Therefore, having invited them in, he lodged them.
    {40 AD. Caesarea.}
    Now on the next-day Peter came forth and went together-with them and some of the brethren
from Joppa went together-with him. 10:24 And on the next-day they entered into Caesarea. Now
Cornelius was expecting them, having called together his relatives and the intimate friends. 10:25 Now
as Peter happened to enter in, Cornelius, having met with him, and having fallen down upon his feet,
worshiped him.
   10:26
          But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up; I myself am also a man. 10:27 And while conversing
together-with him, he entered and finds many who came together. 10:28 And he said to them, You°
know how it is an illegal thing for a man who is a Jew to be joined or to come to the heathen, and
yet God showed to me to speak of no man as common or unclean. 10:29 Hence also, undeniably I
came, having been sent for. Therefore, I am inquiring, for what reason have you° sent for me?
    10:30
          And Cornelius said, I was fasting and praying in the ninth hour {i.e., 3:00 PM} from the fourth
day ago till this hour in my house, and behold, a man stood in my sight in bright apparel, 10:31 and
says, Cornelius, your prayer is heard and your charities were remembered in God’s sight. 10:32
Therefore, send to Joppa, and call Simon, who is surnamed Peter; this one is lodged in the house of
Simon, a tanner, beside the sea. When he has come*; he will be speaking to you. 10:33 Therefore,
promptly I sent word to you, and when you came*, you did* well. Therefore, now we are all here in
God’s sight, to hear all things which have been commanded to you by God.

   10:34
          Now Peter opened his mouth and said, In truth, I comprehend that God is not one who shows-
favoritism 10:35 but in every nation, he who fears him and is working righteousness, is acceptable to
him. 10:36 The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming the good-news of peace through
Jesus Christ (this one is Lord of all). 10:37 You° know, the word concerning Jesus which happened
throughout the whole of Judea, having began from Galilee, after the immersion* which John
preached. 10:38 Jesus who was from Nazareth; how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with
power, who went throughout the land working good* and healing all who were oppressed by the
devil, because God was with him. 10:39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did* both in the
region of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they also assassinated, having hung him upon a tree. 10:40
God raised this one up on the third day and gave him to become manifest, 10:41 not to all the people,
but to witnesses the ones who have been assigned before by God, even to us, who ate and drank
together-with him after he rose* up from the dead. 10:42 And he commanded us to preach to the people
and to thoroughly testify that he himself is the one who has been determined by God to be judge of
the living and the dead. 10:43 To this one, all the prophets are testifying, that through his name
everyone, the one believing in him, is to receive forgiveness of sins.
    10:44
          While Peter is still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all the ones hearing the
word. 10:45 And the believing ones from the circumcision, were astonished, as many as came together-
with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit has also been poured out upon the Gentiles. 10:46 For*
they were hearing them speak in foreign languages and applauding God.
   Then Peter answered, 10:47 Is anyone able to forbid the water, for these not to be immersed*, who
received the Holy Spirit even as we did? 10:48 And he commanded them to be immersed* in the name
of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain some days.

   11:1
         Now the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted
the word of God. 11:2 And when Peter went-up to Jerusalem, the ones from the circumcision were
arguing with him, 11:3 saying, You entered to men having uncircumcision and ate together-with them.
    11:4
         But Peter began and was expounding the matter to them afterwards, saying, 11:5 I was in the
city of Joppa praying and I saw a vision while in a trance, a certain vessel descending, like a great
sheet being dropped down from heaven by the four edges, and it came up-to me. 11:6 Having stared
into what I was considering, and I saw the four-footed mammals of the earth and other beasts and
reptiles and birds of the heaven.
    11:7
         Now I heard a voice saying to me, After having stood up Peter; sacrifice and eat.
   11:8
         But I said, Not-so, Lord, because everything that is common or unclean has never entered into
my mouth.
   11:9
         But a voice answered me the second-time from heaven, What God cleansed, you, do not make
common. 11:10 Now this happened upon three-times and all were pulled up again into heaven. 11:11 And
behold, promptly three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea to
me. 11:12 But the Spirit said for me to go together-with them, making no distinction. Now these six
brethren also came together-with me, and we entered into the house of the man. 11:13 And he reported
to us how he saw the messenger who stood in his house and said to him, Send men to Joppa and send
for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; 11:14 who will be speaking the words to you in which you will be

     11:15
           Now while* I was beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just-like upon us also
at the beginning. 11:16 Now I was reminded of the declaration of the Lord, how he said, John indeed
immersed* in water, but you° will be immersed* in the Holy Spirit.
    11:17
           Therefore, if God gave to them the equal gift like he also did to us after we believed upon the
Lord Jesus Christ, now who was I, that I am able to forbid God? 11:18 But having heard these things,
they were quiet and glorifying God, saying, Consequently*, God gave also repentance to the Gentiles
into life.

And having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he also added Peter to take (and they were the days
of unleavened bread {i.e., Passover}). 12:4 whom having also arrested, he himself placed Peter in prison

and gave him up to four Quarternions of soldiers {i.e., sixteen soldiers} to guard him; planning to lead
him out to the people after the Passover.
    12:5
         Therefore indeed, Peter was being kept in the prison, but intense prayer was happening by the
congregation* to God on his behalf. 12:6 But when Herod was about to lead him out, in that same night
Peter, fallen-asleep between two soldiers, having been bound in two chains, and guards before the
door were guarding the prison. 12:7 And behold, a messenger of the Lord stood by him and a light
shined in the cell and having struck Peter on the rib-cage, he lifted him up, saying, Stand up quickly.
And his chains fell from the hands. 12:8 And the messenger said to him, Gird yourself and tie on your
sandals. Now he did* so. And he says to him, Put your garment around you and follow me. 12:9 And
having gone forth, he was following him, and he did not know that this is true*, the thing happening
through the messenger, but he was thinking to be seeing a vision. 12:10 Now having gone through the
first and second prison, they came upon the iron gate the one bringing them into the city; which was
opened by itself for them, and they went forth and went forward one lane, and immediately the
messenger withdrew from him.
     12:11
           And Peter, became awake in himself, and said, Now I truly know, that the Lord sent his
messenger out and liberated me out-of the hand of Herod and all the expectation of the people of
the Jews. 12:12 And after being conscious of it, he came upon the house of Mary the mother of John
who is surnamed Mark, where a considerable number were accumulating together and were praying.
12:13
      Now after Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maidservant, Rhoda by name, came near to
listen to who was there. 12:14 And having recognized the voice of Peter, full from the joy, she did not
open the gate. But having ran in, she reported Peter to be standing before the gate.
     12:15
           But they said to her, You are insane.
     But she was stoutly affirming to have this so.
     And they were saying, It is his messenger.

           But Peter was remaining and kept knocking. Now having opened the door, they saw him and
were astonished. 12:17 But he, having beckoned to them with the hand to be silent, described to them
how the Lord had led him out-of the prison. Now he said, Report° these things to James and to the
brethren. And having gone forth, he traveled to a different place. 12:18 Now when it became day, there
was not just a small disturbance among the soldiers, as to what then happened to Peter. 12:19 Now
Herod sought him and did not find him, having examined the guards, he commanded them to be led
away for execution. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and was staying there.

here with him, and having persuaded Blastus, the one over the king’s bedroom, they were asking for
peace, because the nourishing of their region is from the king’s region. 12:21 Now on an appointed
day, Herod clothed himself in royal apparel, and having sat upon the judicial-seat, he was publicly
addressing toward them. 12:22 Now the public was shouting out, saying, This is a voice of a god and
not of a man! 12:23 But instantly a messenger of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the
glory and he expired, and became maggot-eaten.

Barnabas, and Symeon the one being called Niger, and Lucius from Cyrene, and Manaen, a foster-
brother of Herod the Tetrarch, and Saul. 13:2 Now while ministering* to the Lord and fasting, the Holy
Spirit said, Separate*° Barnabas and Saul for me, *for the work to which I have called them. 13:3 Then

treachery and all villainy, son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting

be blind and will not see the sun till the next season. Now instantly dimness and darkness fell upon

proconsul believed, having seen what has happened, being astounded upon the teaching of the Lord.

when John preached beforehand the immersion* of repentance to Israel, before his face and before
his entrance. 13:25 Now as John was fulfilling the course, he was saying, Who do you° perceive me
to be {i.e., that I am}? I am not he. But behold, he is coming after me, of whom I am not worthy to
loosen the shoes from his feet. 13:26 Men, brethren, sons of the race of Abraham and the ones who fear
God among you°, the word of this salvation was sent forth to you°. 13:27 For* the ones dwelling in
Jerusalem and their rulers who were ignorant of this one, and they fulfilled the voices of the
prophets, the ones being read on every Sabbath, by having judged him to death. 13:28 And though no
one found a crime worthy of death in him, they still asked Pilate to assassinate him. 13:29 Now as they
completed all things which have been written concerning him, they took him down from the tree and
placed him in a tomb. 13:30 But God raised him up from the dead, 13:31 who was seen upon many days
by the ones who came-up together-with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the
people. 13:32 And we are proclaiming to you° the good-news of the promise which came* to the
fathers, that God has fulfilled this for us, their children, in having raised* up Jesus; 13:33 as it has also
been written in the second Psalm, ‘You are my Son; I have fathered you today.’ {Psa 2:7} 13:34 Now
that he raised* him up from the dead, no longer being about to return to decay, he has spoken thus,
I will be giving you° the holy faithful things of David. {Isa 55:3} 13:35 Hence, he also says in a different
psalm, ‘You will not be giving your Holy One to see decay.’ {Psa 16:10} 13:36 For* indeed David,
having attended to the plan of God in his own generation, fell-asleep and was added to his fathers
and saw decay; {1Ki 2:10} 13:37 but he whom God raised up saw no decay. 13:38 Therefore, men,
brethren, let it be known to you° that forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you° through this one; 13:39
and everyone who believes is made righteous in this one; you° were not able to be made righteous
from all the things of which were in the Law of Moses. 13:40 Therefore, beware°, that what has been
spoken in the prophets might not come upon you°: 13:41 ‘You° despisers, behold° and marvel° and
disappear°, because I am working a work in your° days, a work which you° should never believe, even
if someone should describe it to you°.’ {Hab. 1:5}
    13:42
           But after the Jews went-out of the synagogue, the Gentiles were pleading for the declarations
to be spoken to them at the ensuing Sabbath. 13:43 Now after the synagogue was dissolved, many of
the Jews and the pious Jewish-converts followed Paul and Barnabas; who, while speaking, were
persuading them to remain in the favor of God.
     13:44
           And the coming Sabbath, almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
13:45
      But the Jews, having seen the crowds, were filled up from jealousy, and were contradicting the
things being spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming him.
     13:46
           But Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, It was necessary for the word of God to first
be spoken to you°. But since you° are shoving it away from yourselves and are judging yourselves
not worthy of everlasting life. Behold, how we are turned to the Gentiles. 13:47 For* so the Lord has
commanded to us, saying, ‘I have placed you *for a light of the Gentiles, for you to be *for salvation
to the outermost parts of the earth.’ {Isa 42:6}
     13:48
           And while the Gentiles are hearing this, they were rejoicing and glorifying the word of the
Lord, and they believed as many as were appointing themselves toward everlasting life. 13:49 Now the
word of the Lord was being carried through the whole region.
     13:50
           But the Jews spurred on the pious and prominent women and the foremost ones of the city,
and awakened a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them away from their borders. 13:51

But they shook-off the dust of their feet against them and came to Iconium. 13:52 Now the disciples
were being filled from joy and the Holy Spirit.

    14:1
          Now it happened in Iconium according-to the same thing, for they themselves to enter into the
synagogue of the Jews and to speak thus, so-then for a large multitude to believe, both from the Jews
and from the Greeks. 14:2 But the disobedient Jews awakened and embittered the souls of the Gentiles
against the brethren. 14:3 Therefore, they indeed stayed a considerable time there, speaking boldly in
the Lord, who was testifying to the word of his favor, giving signs and wonders to happen through
their hands. 14:4 But the multitude of the city was split-apart, and some were together-with the Jews
and the others were together-with the apostles. 14:5 Now as it became an impulse of both the Gentiles
and the Jews, together-with their rulers, to abuse them and to stone them, 14:6 while they were
conscious of it, they fled for refuge to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region around
them. 14:7 And they were proclaiming the good-news there.
     14:8
          And there was a certain man, who was sitting in Lystra, being* powerless in the feet, lame
from his mother’s womb, who had never walked. 14:9 This one heard Paul speaking, who, having
stared at him and having seen that he has faith to be cured, 14:10 said with a loud voice, Stand correctly
upon your feet. And he was leaping up and walking.
    14:11
          Now after the crowds saw what Paul did*, they lifted up their voice, saying in Lycaonian, The
gods, who were made similar to men, descended to us. 14:12 And indeed, they were calling Barnabas,
Zeus; but Paul, Hermes, since he himself was the leader of the speech. 14:13 Now the priest of Zeus
of the one being before their city, brought oxen and garlands in the gates and was wishing to sacrifice
them together-with the crowds.
    14:14
          But after the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard it, they ripped their garments and dashed into
the crowd, crying out 14:15 and saying, Men! Why are you° doing* these things? We are also humans,
of like-feelings with you° and are proclaiming the good-news to you°: to turn away from these futile
things to the living God, who made* the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things in them;
14:16
      who permitted all the nations in the generations which have gone-by, to conduct-themselves in
their own ways. 14:17 Although he did not leave himself unwitnessed, by doing* good, giving rainfalls
and fruitful seasons to you° from heaven, filling our hearts with nourishment and joy. 14:18 And saying
these things, they made the crowds cease with difficulty not to sacrifice to them.
    14:19
          But Jews from Antioch and Iconium came upon them there and having persuaded the crowds,
they stoned Paul, and were dragging him outside the city, having supposed him to have died. 14:20 But
the disciples surrounded him. Having rose* up, he entered into the city, and went forth on the next-
day together-with Barnabas to Derbe. 14:21 And having proclaimed the good-news to that city, and
having made a considerable number of disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,
14:22
      further strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith, and that
it is essential for us through many afflictions to enter into the kingdom of God. 14:23 Now elders were
assigned to them in every congregation*, they prayed with fasts, and they consigned them to the Lord,
in whom they had believed.
    14:24
          And having gone through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. 14:25 And having spoken the word

in Perga, they went-down to Attalia; 14:26 and they sailed from there to Antioch, from where they were
giving themselves to the favor of God toward the work which they had fulfilled.

          Now after they came* and gathered the congregation* together, they reported how-much God
had done* with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. 14:28 Now they were
staying there together-with the disciples a time; not just a few.

        And some, came down from Judea, and were teaching the brethren, saying, If you° are not be
circumcised in the custom of Moses, you° are unable to be saved. 15:2 Therefore, after not just a small
dissension and debate by Paul and Barnabas with them happened, the brethren appointed Paul and
Barnabas, and some others out-of them, to go-up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning
this debate.
   15:3
        Therefore indeed, having been sent onward by the congregation*, they were going through both
Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the turning to God of the Gentiles, and they were producing great
joy in all the brethren. 15:4 Now after they came* to Jerusalem, they were accepted by the
congregation*, and the apostles and the elders, and they reported how-much God did* with them. 15:5
But some from the sect of the Pharisees rose* up, who have believed, saying, It is essential to
circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses. {Gal. 2:1}
   15:6
        Now the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see concerning this word {I.e. matter.
Or speech.}. 15:7 Now after much debate had happened, Peter stood up, and said to them, Men,
brethren, you° know that from the days of old among us, God chose through my mouth, that the
Gentiles were to hear the word of the good-news and to believe it. 15:8 And God, the knower of hearts,
testified of them, having given them the Holy Spirit, just-as he did also to us; 15:9 and he made no
distinction between us and them in the faith, having cleansed their hearts.
    15:10
          Therefore, now, why are you° testing God, that is to place a yoke upon the neck of the
disciples, which neither our fathers, nor we were strong-enough to bear? 15:11 But we believe we are
to be saved through the favor of the Lord Jesus, according-to what is in the same manner as they are
also.
   15:12
          Now all the multitude was silent, and they were hearing Barnabas and Paul describing how-
much God did*, in signs and wonders, among the Gentiles through them.

          Now after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brethren, hear° me. 15:14 Symeon
described, just-as how God visited the nations first, to take out-of them a people upon {Or: in} his
name. 15:15 And the words of the prophets agree together-with this; just-as it has been written, 15:16 ‘I
will turn back after these things, and I will build the tabernacle of David again, which has fallen. And
I will build the things which have been ruined again. And I will straighten it, 15:17 *that if the rest of
men may seek out the Lord, and all the nations, upon whom my name has been called upon them,

           Hence, I am deciding not to trouble the ones from the Gentiles, who are turning lives over to
God; 15:20 but to inform them by letter: to abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication,
and from the thing strangled, and from blood. 15:21 For* Moses has the ones who preach him in every
city, from ancient generations, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.
     15:22
           Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, together-with the whole congregation*,
to send chosen men from themselves together-with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, leading men
among the brethren: Judas surnamed Barsabbas and Silas. {Gal. 2:13-15}
     15:23
           They wrote these things through their hand:
     The apostles and the elders and brethren, to the brethren, the ones from the Gentiles throughout
Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. Hello.
    15:24
           Since we heard that some who went forth from us have disturbed you° with words, upsetting
your° souls; saying you° must be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we ordered no such thing;
15:25
      it seemed good to us, after we became united and had chosen men together-with our beloved
Barnabas and Paul to send them to you°, 15:26 men who have given up their lives on behalf of the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15:27 Therefore, we have sent Judas and Silas, themselves also reporting the
same things through their speech. 15:28 For* it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to place no
more burden upon you° other-than these necessary things: 15:29 that you° are to abstain from idol-
sacrifices, and from blood, and from the thing strangled, and from fornication. Keeping yourselves
out-of which such things, you° will be practicing well.

           Therefore indeed, having been dismissed, they came to Antioch, and having gathered the
multitude together, they gave them the letter. 15:31 Now having read it, they rejoiced upon the
encouragement. 15:32 And Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged the brethren
through much speech and further strengthened them. 15:33 Now having spent some time there, they
were dismissed with peace from the brethren to the apostles. 15:34 {T} But it seemed good to Silas to
remain there. 15:35 But Paul and Barnabas were staying in Antioch with many others also, teaching

      Now Barnabas planned to take together-with them John, the one called Mark. 15:38 But Paul was
not deeming it worthy to take Mark together-with them, this one who withdrew away from them
from Pamphylia and did not go together-with them to the work. 15:39 Therefore, it happened: a sharp-
disagreement, so-then they departed from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him to sail
away to Cyprus; 15:40 but Paul went forth, having chosen Silas, having been given to the favor of God

    16:1
          Now he arrived in Derbe and Lystra, and behold, a certain disciple was there, Timothy by
name, the son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, and a Greek father, 16:2 whom was being
testified of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium. 16:3 This one, Paul wished to go forth together-with
him, and he took Timothy and circumcised him because of the Jews who are in those places; for* they
all knew that his father was* Greek. 16:4 Now as they were traveling through the cities, they were
giving them the decrees to observe, the ones having been decided by the apostles and the elders in
Jerusalem. 16:5 Therefore indeed, the congregations* were being strengthened in the faith, and were
abounding in number every day.
    16:6
         Now having gone through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy
Spirit to speak the word in Asia. 16:7 After they came down to Mysia, they were attempting to travel
to Bithyna, and the Spirit did not permit them. 16:8 And having passed-beside Mysia, they went-down
to Troas. 16:9 And a vision was seen by Paul through the night. A certain man, a Macedonian, was
standing, pleading with him and saying, After having crossed over into Macedonia, help us! 16:10 Now
as he saw the vision, we immediately sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that the Lord
has called us to proclaim the good-news to them.

          Therefore, having set-sail from Troas, we made a straight route to Samothrace, and the next
day to Neapolis; 16:12 and from there to Philippi, which is the first city of that part of Macedonia, a
Roman colony. Now we were staying in the same city for some days. 16:13 And on the Sabbath day,
we went forth outside the city beside a river, where it was being supposed to be a place of prayer.
And having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together. 16:14 And a certain woman,
Lydia by name, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira was hearing us and worshiping God, whose
heart the Lord opened to take-heed to the things being spoken of by Paul. 16:15 Now as she and her
household were immersed*, she pleaded with us, saying, If you° have judged me to be faithful to the
Lord, abide° here, having entered into my house. And she constrained us.
    {52 AD. Philippi.}
    16:16
          Now it happened, while traveling to the place of prayer, that a certain maidservant came to
encounter us, having a spirit of divination, who was providing her lords much business by fortune-
telling. 16:17 This maidservant was crying out, having followed-after Paul and us, saying, These men
are bondservants of the Highest God, who are proclaiming to us the way of salvation. 16:18 Now she
was doing* this over many days. But Paul, also was pained and having turned, said to the spirit, I
command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come forth away from her. And it came forth in the
same hour.

          But after her lords saw that the hope of their business was gone, after they grabbed Paul and
Silas, they dragged them into the marketplace in front of the rulers. 16:20 And having led them to the
magistrates, they said, These men, being* Jews, are disturbing our city, 16:21 and are proclaiming
customs which it is not legal for us to accept, nor to do*, being Romans. 16:22 And the crowd stood
up together against them, and the magistrates, having ripped off their garments, were commanding
the sergeants to lash them with rods, 16:23 and who, having laid many wounds upon them, they cast
them into prison, and commanded the jailer to securely guard them. 16:24 Who, having received such
a command, he cast them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the wood stocks.

          But before midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God and the prisoners
were their audience; 16:26 and suddenly a great earthquake happened, so-as for the foundations of the
prison to be shaken, and instantly all the doors were opened and bonds of everyone were laxed. 16:27
But the jailer, became awake and saw the doors of the prison had been opened, pulled the sword he
had and was about to assassinate himself, supposing the prisoners to have fled away. 16:28 But Paul
shouted with a loud voice, saying, Do* nothing evil to yourself; for* we are all here.
   16:29
          Now after he asked for lights, he dashed in and came* in trembling, and fell down before Paul
and Silas. 16:30 And having led them outside, he said, Lords, what is essential for me to do* in-order-
that I might be saved?
    16:31
          Now they said, Believe upon the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, you and your

house.          And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all the ones in his house. 16:33 And
having taken them in that same hour of the night, he fully-washed dirt from their wounds, and he
and all his household were instantly immersed*. 16:34 And he led them up into his house and placed
a table before them, and was glad with all his household, all having believed in God.

          But after it became day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Release those men.

          Now the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent me forth in-
order-that you° should be released. Therefore, now after you° have gone forth, travel° in peace.

          But Paul said to them, They whipped us in public, uncondemned men who are* Romans, and
cast us into prison, and are they now casting us forth secretly? For* no {i.e., no way}, let° them lead but
after having come themselves.
   16:38
          Now the sergeants reported these words to the magistrates and they feared, having heard that
they are Romans. 16:39 And after they came, they pleaded with them, and having led them outside,
they were asking them to go forth away from the city.

          Now after they came forth out-of the prison and they entered into the house of Lydia, and
having seen the brethren, they encouraged them and went forth.

upon three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 17:3 opening and placing before them

that it was essential for the Christ to suffer and to rise* up from the dead, and that this Jesus, whom
I Paul am proclaiming to you°, is the Christ. 17:4 And some out-of them obeyed and had adhered to
Paul and Silas and a large multitude of the pious Greeks, and not just a few of the foremost women.
    17:5
         But the disobedient Jews took for themselves some evil men from among the market-loafers,
and having amassed a crowd, the city was in an uproar. And having stood up against the house of
Jason, they were seeking to lead them into the public court. 17:6 Now after they did not find them,
they were dragging Jason and some brethren in front of the city rulers, crying, These men who have
unsettled the inhabited-earth are also presently here, 17:7 whom Jason has accepted and all these
practice things adverse to the decrees of Caesar, saying a different one to be king, a Jesus. 17:8 Now
hearing these things, they disturbed the crowd and city rulers, 17:9 and having taken sufficient money
from Jason and the rest, they released them.
    17:10
          Now the brethren immediately sent out both Paul and Silas through the night to Berea, who,
after they came* there, were going-forth into the synagogue of the Jews. 17:11 Now these Jews were
noble more than the ones in Thessalonica, those who accepted the word with all eagerness,
examining the Scriptures every day, to see if these things hold up so. 17:12 Therefore indeed, many
out-of them believed; also not just a few of the Greeks from the prominent women and men. 17:13
Now as the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of God was also proclaimed by Paul in
Berea, they also went there, shaking up the crowds. 17:14 Now the brethren then immediately sent out
Paul to travel, like upon the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were remaining back there.

there.

          Now while Paul is waiting for them in Athens, the spirit was being irritated in him, while
viewing the idol ridden city. 17:17 Therefore indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews
and with the pious ones, and every day in the marketplace with the ones who chance by him. 17:18
Now also some of the Epicureans and Stoic philosophers were confronting him and some were
saying, Whatever does this babbler wish to say?
    Some said, He seems to be a proclaimer of strange demons {i.e., gods to the Greeks}, because he is
proclaiming the good-news of Jesus and the resurrection.
    17:19
          And having grabbed him, they led him upon the Areopagus, saying, Are we able to know
what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you? 17:20 For* you are bringing some surprising things
to our ears. Therefore, we plan to know whatever these things might wish to be {i.e., mean}. 17:21 (Now
all from Athens and the inhabiting strangers had leisure time *for nothing other than to tell and to
hear something new.)
    17:22
          Now Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and was saying, Men of Athens, I view you°
as being religious according-to all things. 17:23 For* while going through the city and reviewing your°
worshiped objects, I also found an altar in which had been written, To An Unknown God. Therefore,
I am proclaiming to you°, who are ignorant, this one to whom you° are devout. 17:24 The God, who
made* the world and all things in it, this one being* Lord of heaven and earth, is not dwelling in
temples made* with hands, 17:25 nor is he assisted by men’s hands, as if needy of anything, he himself

giving to all, life and breath in all things. 17:26 And he made* out-of one blood every nation of men
to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons and the borders
of their residence, 17:27 that they are to seek the Lord, if then, they might yet grope-after him and
might find him, for-sure he is* {Or: exists} not far from each one of us. 17:28 For* we live and are moved
and are in him; as some poets also have said according-to you°, For* we are also his offspring.
{Possible reference to a Stoic poet, Aratus of Soli in Cilicia 270BC or Epimendes 600BC.} 17:29 Therefore, being*
the offspring of God, we ought not to suppose that the divine* is similar to gold or silver or stone,
or a carved thing from a craft and the contemplation of man. 17:30 Therefore indeed, God overlooked
the times of ignorance. Hereafter, he is commanding all men everywhere to repent, 17:31 because he
has established a future day in which to judge the inhabited-earth in righteousness in the man whom
he has determined beforehand, having provided the faith to all, by having raised* him from the dead.
{Psa 96:13b, 98:9b}
     17:32
           Now having heard of the resurrection of the dead, some were sneering, but some said, We will
be hearing you concerning this again. 17:33 And so Paul went forth from the midst of them. 17:34 But
some men believed, having joined themselves to him, among whom was also Dionysius the
Areopagite and a woman, Damaris by name, and others together-with them.

     {52-53 AD. Paul at Corinth in Greece.}
     18:1
          Now after these things, Paul, having departed from Athens, came into Corinth. 18:2 And having
found a certain Jew, Aquila by name, Pontus by race, and his wife Priscilla, who recently had come
from Italy because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart out-of Rome, he came to them
18:3
     also because he is of the same-craft. He was remaining and working beside them, for* they were
tent makers, by the craft. 18:4 Now he was reasoning in the synagogue every Sabbath and was
persuading Jews and Greeks.
     18:5
           Now as both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was being very troubled
in the spirit, thoroughly testifying to the Jews: the Christ Jesus. 18:6 Now while they were resisting
us and blaspheming God, he shook-off his garments and said to them, Your° blood is upon your° own
head. I am clean. I will be traveling to the Gentiles from hereafter. 18:7 And having gone-away from
there, he went into the house of a certain man, Justus by name, one who worships God, whose house
was adjoining to the synagogue.

          Now Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together-with his whole house

     And many of the Corinthians hearing, were believing and were being immersed*.
     18:9
           Now the Lord said to Paul through a vision in the night, Do not be afraid, but speak out and
do not be silent, 18:10 because I am with you and no one will be laying a hand upon you to mistreat
you, because many people are in this city believing in me. 18:11 And he sat {i.e., stayed} there a year and
six months, teaching the word of God among them.

           Now Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews stood up united against Paul and led him in
front of the judicial-seat, 18:13 saying, This one is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.
18:14
      But Paul, being about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, Therefore, if it was indeed
some wrongdoing or evil villainy, O Jews, I would tolerate you° according-to reason. 18:15 But if there
is a debate concerning this speech and names and law which is according-to you°, you° will see to
it yourselves; for* I am not willing to be a judge of these things. 18:16 And he drove them away from
the judicial-seat. 18:17 Now all the Greeks grabbed Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and were
beating him before the judicial-seat. And Gallio was about to judge nothing of these things. 18:18 But
Paul, still having remained a considerable number of days, bid farewell to the brethren.
     {Sept., 54 AD. Paul leaves Europe toward Antioch. Claudius dies; Nero becomes Emperor at Rome in Oct.}

sheared his head in Cenchreae; for* he had a vow. 18:19 Now he arrived in Ephesus and he left those
there*. And he himself entered into the synagogue, and he reasoned with the Jews. 18:20 Now they
were requesting him to remain, over more time with them, he did not signal-agreement; 18:21 but he
bid farewell to them and said, It is certainly essential for me to make* the coming feast in Jerusalem
but I will revisit to you° again, God willing. He set-sail away from Ephesus.
    18:22
           And after he came down into Caesarea, he went-up and greeted the congregation* and went-

           Now a certain Jew, Apollos by name, from Alexandria by birth, an eloquent man, arrived in
Ephesus, being mighty in the Scriptures. 18:25 This one was instructing the people the way of the Lord,
and being zealous in his spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning the
Lord, but only knowing the immersion* of John. 18:26 And this one began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. But after Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they themselves took him and expounded more
accurately to him the way of God. 18:27 Now while planning to go into Achaia, the brethren exhorted
him and wrote to the disciples to accept him after he came*. He supported many who had believed
through the favor of God; 18:28 for* he was thoroughly and intensely refuting the Jews in public,
showing through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.

Holy Spirit when you° believed?
     But they said to him, But, we did not hear if there is a Holy Spirit.

     19:3
           And he said to them, Therefore, into what were you° immersed*?
     But they said, Into the immersion* of John.
     19:4
           But Paul said, John indeed immersed* in the immersion* of repentance, saying to the people
in-order-that they should believe into the one who is coming after him, this is: into the Christ Jesus.
19:5
     Now having heard this, they were immersed* into the name of the Lord Jesus. 19:6 And after Paul
laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they were speaking in foreign
languages and were prophesying. 19:7 Now they were in all approximately twelve men.
     19:8
          Now having entered into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly over three months, reasoning
and persuading as to the things concerning the kingdom of God. 19:9 But as some were hardening
themselves and were disobedient, speaking evil of the Way in the sight of the multitude, he withdrew
away from them and separated* the disciples, reasoning every day in the school of a certain Tyrannus.
19:10
      Now this happened over two years; so-then all the ones dwelling in Asia, Jews and Greeks, were
able to hear the word of the Lord Jesus. 19:11 And God was doing* miracles (not obtainable from
man) through the hands of Paul; 19:12 so-as even handkerchiefs or aprons from the touch of his skin
to be brought upon the ones who are sick for them to be set-free from their diseases and for evil
spirits to go forth away from them.
     19:13
           But some exorcists from the strolling Jews undertook the task to name the name of the Lord
Jesus upon the ones who have the evil spirits, saying, We implore you° on the Jesus whom Paul is
preaching. 19:14 Now some (seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, and a high-priest), were doing* this.
     19:15
           But the evil spirit having answered, said, I know Jesus, and I know Paul, but who are you°?
19:16
      And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaping upon them and having mastered and prevailed
against them, so-then they were to flee away out-of that house, naked and traumatized.
     19:17
           Now this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, dwelling in Ephesus, and fear fell upon
them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being applauded. 19:18 Many of the ones, who having
also believed, were coming, confessing and proclaiming their practices. 19:19 Now a considerable
number of the ones who practiced magical arts brought their books together and were burning them
in the sight of all, and they calculated the prices of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of
silver. 19:20 So the word of the Lord was growing and prevailing in dominion.
     19:21
           Now as these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in the spirit to travel into Jerusalem, after
having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, and said, After the coming* to there, it is essential for
me to also see Rome. 19:22 Now having sent Timothy and Erastus, two of the ones serving him, into
Macedonia, he held back in Asia for a short time.
     {56-58 AD. Ephesus. Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians is written.}
     19:23
            Now it happened according-to this time, there was not just a small disturbance concerning
the Way. 19:24 For* a certain man, Demetrius by name (a silversmith making* miniature silver temples
of Artemis), was providing not just a small business to the craftsmen, 19:25 whom he accumulated
together the other workers concerning such things and said, Men, you° know our prosperity is from
this business. 19:26 And you° view and hear, that not only from Ephesus, but almost all of Asia, this
Paul has persuaded and seduced a considerable crowd, saying that they are not gods, the ones born
through human hands. 19:27 But not only is this part for us in peril and it is to go into disrepute but
also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is to be counted as nothing and her majesty is about to

be demolished, what the whole of Asia and inhabited-earth is worshiping.
    19:28
          Now after having heard this, they became full of fury, and were crying out, saying, Great is
Artemis of the Ephesians. 19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion and they rushed united
into the theater, having seized Paul’s fellow traveling-associates, Gaius and Aristarchus, who were
Macedonians. 19:30 Now Paul was planning to enter into the public area, but the disciples were not
permitting him. 19:31 But some also of those from Asia, being friends to him, and having sent for him,
they were pleading with him not to give himself to the theater crowd. 19:32 Therefore, some were
crying something and others another thing; for* the assembly was confused, and most did not know
because of what they had come together. 19:33 But they pushed Alexander forward out-of the crowd,
after the Jews cast him forward. Now Alexander beckoned with the hand, and was wishing to make
a defense to the public. 19:34 But after they recognized that he is a Jew, one voice became out-of them
all over approximately two hours, crying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians. 19:35 But having the
composure of the crowd, the town scribe says, Men of Ephesus, for* what man is there who does not
know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great goddess Artemis and of the fallen
image from Zeus? 19:36 Therefore, these things being undeniable, it is essential for you° to possess
composure and to do* nothing rash. 19:37 For* you° led these men here, who are neither temple looters
nor are blaspheming your* goddess. 19:38 Therefore indeed, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are
together-with him have an account toward anyone, lower-courts are to be led and proconsuls are
here. Let° them accuse one another in them. 19:39 But if you° seek anything concerning different things,
it will be interpreted in the lawful assembly. 19:40 For* we also are in peril to be accused of the riot
concerning today, no cause exists for it and concerning it, will we be able to give account of this
conspiracy? 19:41 And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.

Eutychus by name, while sitting upon the window, being carried-away with deep sleep, while Paul
is reasoning on even more, fell downward, having finally been carried-away from the sleep, from the

Assos, we took him up and went to Mitylene. 20:15 And having sailed from there, we arrived the next
day opposite Chios, and we put the ship in at Samos in another day. And having remained in
Trogyllium, we came to Miletus on the next day. 20:16 For* Paul had decided to sail by Ephesus, for*

into Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
     {Early 59 AD. Miletus.}

           Now from Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the congregation*. 20:18 Now
as they came* to him, he said to them, You° know, from the first day of which I stepped into Asia,
how I happened to be with you° all the time, 20:19 serving* the Lord with all humility and from many
tears, and from tests which befell me among the pacts of the Jews, 20:20 how I did not retreat back in
anything of the things which are advantageous for you°, to proclaim and to teach you° in public
places and in houses, 20:21 thoroughly testifying both to Jews and to Greeks the repentance toward
God and faith toward our Lord Jesus. 20:22 And now, behold, having been bound in the spirit, I travel
to Jerusalem, not knowing the things in it which will be meeting with me there, 20:23 other-than that,
the Holy Spirit is thoroughly testifying to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions are
remaining for me. 20:24 But I make* myself no one in this account, nor am I holding my life as
precious to myself, as I desire to complete my course with joy, and the service which I received from
the Lord Jesus, to thoroughly testify the good-news of the favor of God. 20:25 And now, behold, I
know that you° all, among whom I went through preaching the kingdom of God, will be seeing my
face no more, 20:26 because I testify to you° on this very day, that I am clean from the blood of all men.

shepherd the congregation* of the Lord and God, which the Lord acquired through his own blood.

of the flock, 20:30 and men will be standing up out-of you° yourselves, speaking perverse things, to
pull away the disciples after themselves. 20:31 Hence watch°, remembering that for three years I ceased
not from admonishing each one of you° night and day with tears. 20:32 And hereafter I consign you°
brethren to God, and to the word of his favor, the one being able to build you° up and to give to you°
an inheritance among all the ones who have been made holy. 20:33 I lusted after no one’s silver or gold
or garment. 20:34 You° yourselves know that these hands attended to my needs, and to the ones who
are with me. 20:35 I showed to you° an example in all things, that so laboring, it is essential to help the
weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more fortunate to give
than to receive.

ferrying people over into Phoenicia, we stepped onto it and did set-sail. 21:3 Now after Cyprus
appeared, having left it on the left, we were sailing to Syria and brought* the ship into Tyre; for* the
ship was unloading her cargo there. 21:4 And we remained there* seven days, having found disciples

wives and children, sending us onward until we were outside the city, and having placed the knees

said, The Holy Spirit says these things, The Jews in Jerusalem will be binding the man thus whose
belt this is, and will be giving him up into the hands of the Gentiles. 21:12 Now as we heard these
things, both we and the ones locally were pleading with him not to go-up into Jerusalem.

mlvbible.org                                                                                          223
having believed, and they are* all zealous ones of the law; 21:21 and they were instructed concerning
you, that you are teaching to all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses, saying not
to circumcise themselves, and the children nor to walk according-to the customs.
    21:22
           Therefore, what is this?
    It is essential for the multitude to certainly come together; for* they will be hearing that you have
come. 21:23 Therefore, do* this thing, what we say to you. Four men are with us having a vow upon
themselves. 21:24 After you have taken these and purified yourself together-with them, and be spent
over them {i.e., probably ‘pay their expenses’} in-order-that they may shave the head and may know that
all the things of which they have been instructed concerning you are nothing, but you yourself also
march accordingly, observing the law.
     21:25
           But concerning the ones of the Gentiles who have believed, we decided and informed them
by letter to observe no such thing, except to keep themselves from: idol-sacrifice, and blood, and the
thing strangled, and fornication.
   21:26
          Then Paul having taken the men and having been purified together-with the men was going-
into the temple in the next day, thus thoroughly proclaiming the fulfillment of the days of
purification, until the offering was offered on behalf of each one of them.
    21:27
           Now as the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, after they saw him
in the temple, were inciting all the crowd and put hands upon him, 21:28 crying out, Men, Israelites,
help°! This one is the man who is teaching all people everywhere, against the Jewish people and the
law and this place, and even more, he led Greeks into the temple and he has desecrated this holy
place. 21:29 For* they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian together-with him among the city, whom they
were supposing that Paul had led into the temple.
   21:30
          And the whole city was moved and a running of the people together happened, and after they
grabbed Paul, they were dragging him outside the temple and immediately the doors were locked.
    21:31
           But while seeking to kill him, information came-up to the commander of the cohort {600
soldiers}, that the whole Jerusalem has been incited to riot. 21:32 Who promptly, having taken soldiers
and centurions, ran down upon them. And the ones who saw the commander and the soldiers, ceased
beating Paul. 21:33 Now having drawn near, the commander grabbed him, and commanded him to be
bound with two chains, and was inquiring as to whoever he might be, and what has he practiced
wrongly? 21:34 But some in the crowd were crying one thing, others another thing, and not being able
to know the certainty of who he was because of the uproar, he commanded him to be led into the
encampment. 21:35 But when he came* upon the steps, it befell him to be bore by the soldiers because
of the violence of the crowd, 21:36 for* the multitude of the people was following, crying out, Take
him away.
    21:37
          But while Paul is about to be led into the encampment, he says to the commander, If it is legal
for me to speak to you, may I?
    And he said, Do you know Greek? 21:38 Are you not then the Egyptian who unsettled the city
before these days, and led the four thousand men of the assassins out into the wilderness?
    21:39
           But Paul said, I am a Jew, indeed a man from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant
city, and I beseech of you, permit* me to speak to the people. 21:40 Now having permitted* him, Paul,
standing upon the steps, beckoned with the hand to the people, and after it became much silence, he
was shouting to the crowd in the Hebrew language, saying, [Acts 22] TOC 22:1 Men, brethren and


224                                                                                               mlvbible.com
fathers! Hear° now my defense to you°. 22:2 But having heard that he was shouting to them in the
Hebrew language, they provided him even more quietness, and he says, 22:3 I indeed am a man, a Jew,
and having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but having been reared in this city beside the feet of
Gamaliel, having been educated according-to the exactness of the Law of our forefathers, being* a
zealous one of God, just-as you° all are today; 22:4 I who persecuted this Way till death, binding and
giving into prisons both men and women. 22:5 As also the high-priest and all the eldership can testify
of me; from whom I also accepted letters to the brethren, and I was traveling to Damascus. I will be
leading also the ones being there who had been bound to Jerusalem in-order-that they might be
punished.
       {Examples of those who are saved in the New Testament: Acts 2:14-42; 8:5-13; 8:30-39; 10:34-48; 16:13-15;
16:25-34; 18:8a; 18:8b; 19:1-7; Saul/Apostle Paul: 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18.}
    22:6
          Now it happened to me, while traveling and drawing near to Damascus, around midday, a
considerable light from heaven suddenly happened to flash around me. 22:7 And I fell to the solid-
ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?
    22:8
          But I answered, Who are you, Lord?
    And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.
    22:9
         But the ones who are together-with me indeed saw the light and became fearful, but they did
not hear with understanding the voice of the one speaking to me. 22:10 But I said, What should I do*,
Lord?
    But the Lord said to me, When you have stood up, travel into Damascus, and it will be spoken to
you there concerning all things which have been appointed for you to do.
    22:11
          Now as I was not seeing anything apart from the glory of that light. I came into Damascus,
being led by the hand by the ones being there together-with me. 22:12 Now a certain one named
Ananias, a devout man according-to the law, being testified of by all the Jews dwelling there, 22:13
came to me, and having stood by me said to me, Brother Saul, recover your sight! And I looked up
at him in the same hour. 22:14 Now he said, The God of our fathers assigned you to know his will, and
to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth. 22:15 Because you will be a witness for
him to all men of what things you have seen and heard. 22:16 And now, why are you hesitating? After
you have stood up, be immersed* and fully-wash away your sins, having called upon the name of the
Lord.
    22:17
          Now it happened to me, having returned to Jerusalem, and at my praying in the temple, then
it was for me to become into a trance, 22:18 and to see him saying to me, Hurry, and go forth quickly
out-of Jerusalem, because they will not be accepting the testimony from you concerning me.
    22:19
          And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I was imprisoning and whipping them in every
one of the synagogues, the ones who believe upon you; 22:20 and when the blood of Stephen, your
witness, was being shed, I myself was also standing there and was consenting to the assassination,
guarding the garments of the ones assassinating him.
    22:21
          And he said to me, Travel on, because I will be sending you out to the Gentiles who are afar.
    22:22
          Now they were hearing him till this speech, and they lifted up their voice, saying, Take such
a one away from the earth; for* it was not proper for him to live.
    22:23
          Now from them crying out and tossing off their garments and casting dust into the air, 22:24 the
commander commanded him to be led into the encampment, and said, He is to be interrogated with


mlvbible.org                                                                                          225
scourges, in-order-that he might fully know because of what crime they were shouting out against
him so.
     22:25
            But as he stretched him out with the straps, Paul said to the centurion who is standing there,
If it is legal for you° to scourge a Roman man and uncondemned, go ahead {i.e., sarcasm}?
      22:26
            But having heard it, the centurion went to the commander and reported to him, saying,
Behold, what are you about to do*? For* this man is a Roman.
     22:27
            Now the commander came and said to him, Tell me if you are a Roman.
     Now he said, Yes.
     22:28
            And the commander answered, I procured this citizenship of a large sum.
     But Paul said, But I have even been born Roman.
     22:29
            Therefore, the ones who are about to interrogate him immediately withdrew from him. The
commander was also afraid, having fully known that he is a Roman, and because he has bound him.
     22:30
            But on the next-day, planning to know the certainty of why he is accused of something from
the Jews, he loosed him from the bonds, and commanded the high-priests and their whole council
to come and having led Paul there he stood him toward them.
                                               [Acts 23] TOC
     23:1
          Now Paul, having stared toward the council, said, Men, brethren, I have behaved-as a Jewish
citizen toward God in all good conscience till this day.
     23:2
          But the high-priest Ananias commanded to the ones standing beside him to beat the mouth of
Paul.
     23:3
          Then Paul said to him, God is about to beat you, you whitewashed wall. And you sit judging
me according-to the law, and yet violating the law, you are commanding me to be beaten.
     23:4
           But the ones standing beside him said, Are you reviling God’s high-priest?
     23:5
           And Paul said, Brethren, I did not know that he was the high-priest; for* it has been written,
‘You will not speak evilly of a ruler of your people.’ {Exo 22:28} 23:6 But after Paul knew that the one
part are Sadducees and the other are Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men, brethren, I am a
Pharisee, a son of a Pharisee. I am being judged concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead.
23:7
      But after he himself spoke this, a dissension came* from the Pharisees and the multitude was
split-apart. 23:8 (For* the Sadducees indeed say no resurrection is to be, neither messenger nor spirit,
but the Pharisees are confessing both.)
     23:9
           Now a great outcry happened, and part of the scribes of the Pharisees stood up and were
quarreling, saying, We are finding no evil in this man, but if a spirit or a messenger spoke to him,
we should not quarrel against God. 23:10 Now after much dissension happened, the commander was
scared, lest Paul might be torn to shreds by them, and commanded the army to go-down and to seize
him from the midst of them, and lead him back into the encampment.
     23:11
            Now when the Lord stood by him the next night, he said, Paul, have courage; for* as you have
thoroughly testified concerning me in Jerusalem, so it is essential for you to also testify in Rome.
      23:12
             Now after it became day, some of the Jews made* a conspiracy and they vowed for
themselves, saying, they were neither to eat nor to drink until which time they should kill Paul. 23:13


226                                                                                         mlvbible.com
Now they were more-than forty who had made* this gang, 23:14 who came near to the high-priests and
the elders and said, We vowed that ourselves are accursed, to taste nothing until which time we
should kill Paul. 23:15 Therefore, now, you°, together-with the council, disclose° it to the commander
*
  that he should be led to you° the next-day, as if being about to investigate more accurately the things
concerning him. Now we are ready to assassinate him before he is to draw near.
    23:16
           But the son of Paul’s sister, having heard of their murderous plot, came* and entered into the
encampment and reported to Paul. 23:17 Now Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Lead this
young-man away to the commander; for* he has something to report to him.
    23:18
           Therefore indeed, having taken him, he led him to the commander and says, Paul the prisoner,
having called me, asked me to lead this young-man to you, who has something to say to you.
    23:19
           Now the commander grabbed his hand and departed privately, and was inquiring, What is it
which you have to report to me?
    23:20
           Now he said, The Jews themselves covenanted* together to ask you *that you should lead Paul
into the Jewish council the next-day, as if being about to inquire more accurately something
concerning him. 23:21 Therefore you, do not be persuaded by them; for* more-than forty men out-of
them are plotting against him, who vowed for themselves neither to eat nor to drink until they should
assassinate him, and they are ready now, waiting for the promise from you.
    23:22
           Therefore indeed, the commander dismissed the young-man, having commanded him to tell
no one that you disclosed these things to me.
     {May 25, 59 AD. Paul is sent to the political capital at Caesarea.}
    23:23
           And having called to him a certain two of the centurions, he said, Prepare° from {i.e., at} the
third hour of the night {i.e., 9:00 PM} two hundred soldiers and seventy horsemen and two hundred
spearmen, *that they should travel to Caesarea, 23:24 and animals to be present, in-order-that after they
mounted Paul upon one of them, they might save him for Felix the governor.
     23:25
           Now he wrote a letter in this pattern containing:
23:26
      Claudius Lysias to the most-excellent governor Felix. Hail to you. 23:27 When this man was taken
by the Jews and being about to be assassinated by them, I stood up together-with the army and
liberated him, having learned that he is a Roman. 23:28 But planning to know the accusation because
of what they were accusing him, I led him into their council; 23:29 whom I found being accused
concerning debates of their law, having nothing in way of an accusation worthy of death or of bonds.
23:30
      But after it was divulged to me of a future pact by the Jews *for the man, I promptly sent him to
you, having also commanded the accusers to speak the things to him in front of you. Good-bye.
     23:31
           Therefore indeed, the soldiers, according-to the thing which had been commanded to them,
took Paul and led him through the night to Antipatris. 23:32 But on the next-day, having permitted the
horsemen to travel together-with him, they returned to the encampment, 23:33 who, having entered into
Caesarea, and having given over the letter to the governor, also presented Paul to him. 23:34 Now the
governor read the letter and having asked: What province is he from? And having inquired: he is
from Cilicia. 23:35 He was saying, I will thoroughly hear you whenever your accusers also come*. And
he commanded him to be guarded in Herod’s palace.

    {May 30, 59 AD. Paul before Felix, a prisoner two years at Caesarea. In 59 AD Festus becomes governor of Judea.}
     24:1
          Now after five days, the high-priest Ananias with the elders and an orator came-down,
someone named Tertullus, who disclosed to the governor the charges against Paul. 24:2 Now when
Paul himself was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, We are obtaining much peace
through you and public-reforms are happening to this nation through your forethought. 24:3 We are
accepting it both in all things and everywhere, with all thanksgiving, most-excellent Felix. 24:4 But
in-order-that I may not hinder you upon more-than this, I plead with you to hear us briefly in your
gentleness. 24:5 For* we have found this man to be a plague, and he is moving this dissension to all
the Jews throughout the inhabited-earth. And he is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes, 24:6 who
also attempted to profane the temple; whom we also took-hold of, {T} and wished to be judged
according-to our law. 24:7 Now Lysias the commander passed-beside, and with much violence, took
Paul away out-of our hands, 24:8 having commanded his accusers to come to you. From whom, you
will be able, having examined him, to fully know concerning all these things of which we are
accusing him. 24:9 But the Jews themselves also banded together in the attack, thus claiming these
things to hold truth.
    24:10
          Now after the governor signaled to him to speak, Paul answered, I know you are a judge to
this nation out-of many years experience. I am cheerfully making my defense with the things
concerning myself. 24:11 You surely are able to know that there are not more-than twelve days to me
from which time I went-up in Jerusalem (I will worship there); 24:12 and they did not find me
reasoning angrily with anyone, or making* a hostile gathering of the crowd in the temple, nor in the
synagogues, nor in the city, 24:13 nor are they able to present things concerning me, of which they are
now accusing me. 24:14 But I confess this thing to you, that thus I am giving-divine-service to the God
of our forefathers according-to The Way, which they call* a sect, believing all things which are
according-to the law and which have been written in the prophets. 24:15 I have hope toward God,
which these themselves also have; they are waiting for that time there will be a future resurrection
of the dead, both of the righteous and unrighteous. 24:16 But I apply myself in this, having a guilt-free
conscience always toward God and men. 24:17 Now I came* through many years (I will do* charities
and offerings to my nation); 24:18 in which they found me, having been purified in the temple, not with
a crowd, nor with an uproar with some Jews from Asia, 24:19 whom it is essential for them to be here
and to accuse me in front of you, if they may have anything to accuse me. 24:20 Or let° these men
themselves say what wrongdoing they found in me when I stood in front of the council, 24:21 or
concerning this one voice of which I cried out, standing among them. I am being judged by you°
today concerning the resurrection of the dead.
    24:22
          But having heard these things and knowing more accurately concerning The Way, Felix
himself postponed judging them, and said, Whenever Lysias the commander comes-down, I will be
investigating the things against you°. 24:23 And he himself commanded the centurion to guard Paul
and for him to have relief and to forbid no one of his own to attend or to come near to him.
    24:24
          Now after some days, Felix came* together-with Drusilla, his wife, being a Jewess, and sent
for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 24:25 But while he himself is reasoning
concerning righteousness and self-control and the future judgment which is to be, Felix became


228                                                                                           mlvbible.com
fearful, and answered, Travel on, hereafter having time and having taken the opportunity, I myself
will call you. 24:26 (And while hoping at the same-time that monies will be given to him by Paul, *that
he might loose him.) Hence, he was conversing with him, and sending for him frequently. 24:27 But
after two years were fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus, and wishing to lay up
favors for himself with the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.

    {July, 61 AD. Paul’s appearance before Festus.}
    25:1
          Therefore, after three days, having stepped into the province, Festus went-up to Jerusalem
from Caesarea. 25:2 Now the high-priest and the foremost ones of the Jews disclosed to him things
against Paul, and they were pleading with him, 25:3 asking for a favor against him, *that he might send
for him to come to Jerusalem; making* a plot to assassinate him in his journey.
    25:4
         Therefore indeed, Festus answered that Paul is to be kept in Caesarea, but he himself is about
to travel out there shortly. 25:5 Therefore, he says, The mighty ones among you° have gone-down
together-with me if there is anything evil in this man, let° them accuse him.
    25:6
         Now having stayed among them more than ten days, he went-down to Caesarea. On the next-
day having sat upon the judicial-seat, he commanded Paul to be led before him. 25:7 Now after he
came*, the Jews who had come-down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and cruel
accusations against Paul, which they were not strong-enough to show.
    25:8
          Then Paul, making his defense, said, Neither at the law of the Jews nor at the temple nor at
Caesar, did I sin in anything.
    25:9
         But Festus, wishing to lay up a favor for himself with the Jews, answered and said to Paul, Are
you willing, after having gone-up to Jerusalem, to be judged there concerning these things in front
of me?
    25:10
           But Paul said, I am standing in front of Caesar’s judicial-seat, where it is essential for me to
be judged. I was not wronging the Jews, as you also fully well know. 25:11 For* if I indeed am
wronging anyone, and have practiced anything worthy of death, I do not renounce to die, but if there
is nothing of what these are accusing me; no one is able to grant me to them. I myself am appealing
to Caesar. 25:12 Then Festus, having spoken together with the council, answered, You yourself have
appealed to be in front of Caesar, then you will be traveling over to Caesar.
    25:13
           Now after some days elapsed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived in Caesarea and greeted
Festus. 25:14 Now as he was staying there many days, Festus submitted to the King, the things
according-to Paul’s case, saying, There is a certain man, a prisoner, who has been left behind by
Felix; 25:15 concerning whom, having happened of me {i.e., when I got} into Jerusalem, the high-priests
and the elders of the Jews disclosed things to me, asking for a sentence against him. 25:16 To whom
I answered, It is not a custom with Romans to grant as a favor any man to destruction, preferably
before he who is accused, might have the accusers according-to face {i.e., face to face}, and might
receive a chance for defense concerning the accusation.
     25:17
           Therefore, after they themselves came together here, I made* no postponement of their
meeting to the next day, having sat upon the judicial-seat, I commanded the man to be led there. 25:18
Concerning whom, after the accusers stood up, they were bringing no accusation of things as I was


mlvbible.org                                                                                                 229
perceiving; 25:19 but they were having some debates with him concerning his own religion and
concerning someone named Jesus, who had died, whom Paul was claiming him to be living. 25:20 But
being perplexed as to the debate concerning this, I was saying to him, if he might be willing to travel
to Jerusalem and to be judged there concerning these things. 25:21 But after Paul himself appealed to
be kept *for the decision of the Emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I should send him to
Caesar. 25:22 But Agrippa said to Festus, I was also planning to hear from the man myself.
     Now he says, You will hear him on the next-day.
     25:23
           Therefore, on the next-day, Agrippa and Bernice came with much pomp, and entered into the
auditorium together-with both, the commanders and men according-to prominence, who are from
the city, and after Festus commanded, Paul was led before him. 25:24 And Festus says, King Agrippa,
and all men who are here together-with us, you° are viewing this one, concerning whom all the
multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying it is to be essential for him
to live no longer. 25:25 But I comprehended for myself that he has done* nothing worthy of death, and
I decided to send him, since this one himself had also appealed to the Emperor; 25:26 concerning
whom, I do not have any certainty as what to write to my lord. Hence, I led him in front of you° and
especially in front of you, King Agrippa, *that, after his examination has happened, I might have
something to write. 25:27 For* it seems unreasonable to me to be sending a prisoner, and not to signify
the accusations against him.

     {Aug., AD 61. Paul before Agrippa.}
     26:1
           Now Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted* for you to speak on behalf of yourself. Then Paul
stretched out the hand and was making his defense. 26:2 Concerning all of which I am accused by the
Jews, King Agrippa, I have deemed myself fortunate today, being about to make my defense in front
of you; 26:3 especially because you are an expert of all things according-to the things of the Jews, both
customs and debates. Hence, I beseech of you to hear me patiently.
     26:4
          Therefore, my lifestyle indeed which happened from my youth up, from the beginning in my
own nation and in Jerusalem, all the Jews know this. 26:5 If they should wish to testify (knowing me
beforehand, from the start), that I lived as a Pharisee according-to the strictest sect of our religion.
26:6
     And now I am standing here, being judged against the hope of the promise which came* by God
to the fathers; 26:7 to which our twelve tribes, intensely giving-divine-service to God night and day,
are hoping to achieve concerning which hope I am accused by the Jews, O king Agrippa!
     26:8
          Why is it judged as unbelievable with you°, if God is raising the dead?
     26:9
           Therefore, I indeed thought to myself, for it to be essential for me to practice many things
adverse to the name of Jesus of the Nazarenes. 26:10 This is what I also practiced in Jerusalem, and
I locked up many of the holy-ones in prisons, having received authority from the high-priests, and
while they were being assassinated, I brought my voting-pebble {i.e., vote} against them. 26:11 And
punishing them often throughout all the synagogues, I was urging them to blaspheme, and being
exceptionally enraged with them, I was persecuting them, insofar as possible, even to the cities
outside our nation.

16:25-34; 18:8a; 18:8b; 19:1-7; Saul/Apostle Paul: 9:17-18, 22:6-16, 26:12-18.}
    26:12
          In which also, while traveling to Damascus with the authority and commission from the high-
priests, 26:13 on the road in the middle of the day, O king, I saw a light from heaven beyond the
brilliance of the sun, which shone around me and the ones traveling together-with me. 26:14 Now after
all of us fell down to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language,
Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is harsh for you to kick toward cattle-prods.
    26:15
          But I said, Who are you, Lord?
    But the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. 26:16 But rise* and stand upon your feet;
for* to this end, I was seen by you, to assign you to be an attendant and a witness both of the things
which you saw, and of the things which will be seen by you. 26:17 I will be liberating you from the
Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you, 26:18 to open their eyes, to turn them
from darkness, into light, and from the authority of the Adversary to God, in order for them to
receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among the ones who have been made holy in faith,
the faith in me.
    26:19
          Hence, O King Agrippa, I did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision. 26:20 But I was
proclaiming first to them in Damascus, and in Jerusalem, and then to all the region of Judea and to
the Gentiles, to repent and to turn to God, practicing works worthy of repentance. 26:21 Because of
these things, the Jews, having taken me in the temple, were attempting to exterminate me. 26:22
Therefore, having obtained the assistance which is from God, I am standing till this day, testifying
both to the little and to the great, saying nothing outside of what things both the prophets and Moses
spoke of being about to happen. 26:23 If the suffering Christ, if the Christ was first from the
resurrection of the dead, then he is about to proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.
    26:24
          Now he makes his defense with these things.
    Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are insane; your many scholarships is turning you into
the insane.
    26:25
           But Paul says, I am not insane, most-excellent Festus, but I am speaking out the words of
truth and self-discipline. 26:26 For* the king knows concerning these things, with whom I am also
speaking boldly; for* I am saying: I am persuaded that not any of these things were done* to elude
him; for* this thing has not been done* in a corner. 26:27 King Agrippa, Do you believe the prophets?
I know that you believe.
    26:28
          But Agrippa said to Paul, Are you persuading me to become a Christian in few words?
    26:29
           But Paul said, I would pray to God, that both in a few words and in many words, not only
you, but also all who hear me today, are to become such: what sort of person I am, except-for these
bonds.
    26:30
          And after he himself said these things, the king and the governor and Bernice and the ones
sitting together-with them stood up; 26:31 and having departed, they were speaking to one another,
saying, This man is practicing nothing worthy of death or bonds.
    26:32
          But Agrippa said to Festus, This man was able to have been released, if he had not appealed
to Caesar.

    {Aug. 21 - Nov. 1, 61 AD. Mediterranean Sea. The voyage to Rome.}
    27:1
          Now as it was decided for us to sail toward Italy, and they were giving to a centurion, Julius


mlvbible.org                                                                                          231
by name, of the Emperor’s cohort, Paul and some other prisoners. 27:2 Now having stepped onto it,
in an Adramyttium ship, which is about to sail throughout the places along Asia, we did set-sail,
also being together-with us was Aristarchus, a Macedonian, a Thessalonian. 27:3 And we brought* the
ship into Sidon in another day and Julius treated Paul humanely and permitted* him to obtain care,
traveling to his friends. 27:4 And having set-sail from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because
the winds were going to be adverse. 27:5 And having sailed through the deep-sea against Cilicia and
Pamphylia, we came down to Myra, a city of Lycia. 27:6 And the centurion found a ship of Alexandria
from there sailing to Italy, and he had us step onto it. 27:7 Now in a considerable number of days, we
were voyaging slowly and happened to be against Cnidus with difficulty; the wind was not
permitting us to land. We sailed under the lee of Crete against Salmone; 27:8 and coasting-along it
with difficulty, we came to a certain place being called Good Harbors; which was near the city of
Lasea.
    27:9
         Now after a considerable amount of time had elapsed and the voyage being already dangerous,
because also the fast {i.e., Yom Kippur} was to have already passed-away, Paul was advising them, 27:10
saying to them, Men, I view that the voyage is about to be with disaster and much damage, not only
of the load and of the ship, but also of our lives. 27:11 But the centurion was being persuaded by the
helmsman and by the ship-owner, rather than by the things being spoken by Paul. 27:12 But the harbor,
being* unfit for a wintering, most of the council purposed to set-sail from there, if somehow they
might be able to winter, after they arrived in Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, while looking down the
northwest and down the southwest. 27:13 Now after wind from the south blew softly, having thought
to have taken-hold of their purpose, they lifted the anchor up and were coasting-along, closer to
Crete. 27:14 But after not much time, a typhoon wind, being called Euroclydon, was cast against her;
27:15
      and after the ship was seized and not being able to head-into the wind, having given her to the
wind, we were being carried along. 27:16 Now having ran under the lee of a certain isle called Clauda,
we were strong-enough to become skippers of the boat with difficulty; 27:17 which having lifted it up,
they were using cables, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they might fall into the sandbars of
Syrtis, they lowered the tackling and so they were being carried along. 27:18 But our ship was being
extremely storm-tossed, the next day they were making* a jettison of the cargo; 27:19 and we tossed
out the tackling of the ship the third day with our own hands. 27:20 But while neither sun nor stars are
appearing upon most days and not just a small storm was laying down upon us, all hope for us to be
saved was furthermore being taken-away.
    27:21
          Now they are* very much famished, then Paul, stood in the midst of them, said, O men, it was
indeed essential to have obeyed me and to not set-sail away from Crete and then to gain this disaster
and damage. 27:22 And hereafter, I am advising you° to be cheerful; for* there will be no termination
of life from among you°, however of the ship, yes. 27:23 For* a messenger of the God (whose I am, to
whom I also am giving-divine-service to) stood beside me this night, 27:24 saying, Do not fear, Paul;
it is essential for you to stand-before Caesar and behold, God has granted to you all the ones sailing
with you. 27:25 Hence, be° cheerful, men; for* I believe God, that it will be so according-to what is in
the manner that it has been spoken to me. 27:26 But it is essential for us to fall onto a certain island.
    27:27
          Now as it became the fourteenth night, our being carried to and fro in the Adriatic Sea, in the
middle of the night, the sailors were perceiving some region to be preceding them. 27:28 And having
sounded, they found twenty fathoms, and after a little bit of an interval of time, having sounded


232                                                                                          mlvbible.com
again, they found fifteen fathoms. 27:29 And fearing lest we might fall into rough places, they tossed
the four anchors from the stern and was praying for it to become day. 27:30 But the sailors were
seeking to flee out-of the ship and having lowered the boat into the sea in pretext, as though being
about to heave out anchors from the prow, 27:31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, If these
sailors do not remain in the ship, you° are not able to be saved. 27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the
ropes of the boat and permitted her to fall. 27:33 Now till which time it was about to become day, Paul
was encouraging them all to take some nourishment, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you°
are expecting to arrive; you° are continuing famished, having taken nothing to eat for yourselves.
27:34
      Hence I am encouraging you° to take some nourishment; for* this is* for your° salvation; for* not
a hair will be falling from the head of any one of you°. 27:35 Now having said these things and having
taken bread, he gave-thanks to God in the sight of all, and he broke it and began to eat. 27:36 Now
when all became cheerful, they themselves also took nourishment. 27:37 Now we were in the ship, all
two hundred and seventy-six souls. 27:38 Now having been satisfied from the nourishment, they were
lightening the ship, casting the grain forth into the sea.
     {Nov. 1, 61 AD. Shipwreck on Malta.}
     27:39
           Now when it became day, they were not recognizing the land. But they were considering a
certain bay, having a beach into which they planned if possible to drive the ship. 27:40 And having
taken-off the couplings to the anchors, they were permitting them to fall in the sea, having laxed the
rudders’ couplings at the same-time. And having lifted up the foresail to the blowing wind, they were
heading toward the beach. 27:41 But having fallen into a place at the intersection of two seas, they
beached the cargo-ship, and indeed the prow stuck and remained unshakable, but the stern was being
dissolved by the violence of the waves.
    27:42
           Now the soldiers’ plan happened to be that* they should kill the prisoners, lest some, having
swam out, should flee. 27:43 But the centurion, planning to save Paul, forbade them from their will,
and commanded the ones being able to swim, after they first tossed themselves over to go-out over
to the land; 27:44 and the rest, who indeed were upon planks and who were upon any other things from
the ship. And so it happened, all were to be saved upon the land.

     {Nov. - Feb. 62 AD. Malta.}
     28:1
           And having been saved, then they recognized that the island is called Malta. 28:2 Now the
barbarians were providing for us and we obtained not just kindliness, for* they lit a fire, and took us
all in, because of the standing rainfall and because of the cold. 28:3 But after Paul twisted together a
bunch of brush and laid it upon the fire, a viper attached to his hand, after it came forth through the
brush from the warmth. 28:4 Now as the barbarians saw the snake hanging from his hand, they were
saying to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, having been saved out-of the sea,
justice did not permit him to live. 28:5 Therefore indeed, he shook-off the snake into the fire and
suffered no evil. 28:6 But they were expecting him to be about to swell up or to suddenly fall down
dead. But after they themselves were expecting it over much time and viewing nothing improper
happening to him, having a turnabout, they were saying him to be a god.
    28:7
          Now in the regions around that place, were* farms belonging to the foremost one of the island,

Publius by name, who, having accepted us, lodged us courteously three days. 28:8 Now it happened,
that the father of Publius lay sick, being troubled with fevers and dysentery, to whom Paul, having
entered and prayed and laid his hands upon him, healed him. 28:9 Therefore, after this happened, the
rest who have any sicknesses in the island were also coming near and were being healed, 28:10 who
also honored us with many honors, and while setting-sail, they placed upon the ship the things for
our need.
     28:11
           Now after three months, we were led to a ship of Alexandria with an insignia of The Twin
Brothers which had wintered in the island.
     {March, 62 - March 64. Rome.}
    28:12
           And having been led into Syracuse, we remained there three days. 28:13 From where, we went
around and arrived at Rhegium and after one day a south wind came* upon us and on the second day
we came to Puteoli; 28:14 where we found brethren and were encouraged to remain upon {i.e., with}
them seven days and so we came to Rome. 28:15 And the brethren from there, after they heard things
concerning us, came to the encounter with us up-to the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns;
whom having seen, Paul gave-thanks to God and took courage.
     28:16
           Now when we came to Rome, the centurion gave the prisoners to the camp-commander, but
Paul was permitted* to abide by himself together-with the soldier guarding him.
     28:17
           Now after three days, Paul happened to call together the ones who are the foremost of the
Jews and after they came together, he said to them, Men, brethren, I practiced nothing adverse to
the Jewish people or the customs of our forefathers. I, a prisoner from Jerusalem, was given up into
the hands of the Romans. 28:18 The Romans who, having examined me, were planning to release me,
because no crime worthy of death was found to exist in me. 28:19 But the Jews were speaking against
it, then I was urged to appeal to Caesar; not like I hold anything of which to accuse my nation. 28:20
Therefore, because of this accusation, I pleaded to see and to speak to you°, for* I am encompassed
with this chain because of the hope of Israel.
     28:21
           But they said to him, We neither accepted writings from Judea concerning you, nor did
anyone of the brethren come* here and report or speak anything evil concerning you. 28:22 But we
deem it worthy to hear from you what things you are mindful of; for* indeed, concerning this sect,
it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.
     28:23
           Now having appointed him a day, they were coming to him, more into the lodging, to whom
he was expounding the word, thoroughly testifying of the kingdom of God also persuading them with
the things concerning Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until
dusk. 28:24 And some were obeying and some were disbelieving the things being spoken. 28:25 But
being in disagreement with one another, they were dismissing themselves after Paul said just one
declaration, The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, 28:26 saying, ‘Travel
to this people and say, In hearing you° will hear and yet should never understand, and in seeing you°
will see and yet should never know, 28:27 for* the heart of this people became-callous and they have
selectively heard with their ears and they closed their eyes, lest, they should see with their eyes and
should hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should return and I will be
healing them.’ {Isa 6:9-10}


234                                                                                      mlvbible.com
   28:28
         Therefore, let it be known to you°, that the salvation from God was sent to the Gentiles and
they themselves will be hearing it. 28:29 And after he said these things of him, the Jews went away,
having much debate among themselves.
   28:30
         Now Paul remained two whole years in his own rented-house and was accepting all who
travel to him, 28:31 preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus
Christ with all boldness, unforbidden by any.

    After you know about who Jesus was in the first four books and have followed an example of how to become a
Christian in Acts, then comes the remainder of the New Testament. A collection of letters written to Christians, helping
them to know how to live their lives for Christ Jesus after they are saved from their sins. They were not arranged in
chronological order so to read and learn from them as God intended, it is better to follow the order of the Simple Reading
Schedule. This way each letter will build upon each other. You will also have some preparation before you read Romans,
a very intense letter. Each letter deals with specific issues and problems that different groups of Christians were
struggling with at the time of the writing. The most common problem was that Jewish false teachers were binding the
Gentile Christians under the Law of Moses. However, up front, the Law, spoken of in the letters is in a very generalized
way as “Law” vs. “the Law” most often. It is the old covenant of God, the Old Testament from Genesis through Malachi.
    The first nine letters are written by the apostle Paul to specific congregations of the Lord’s body in various cities and
are named for the area in which those Christians lived. The next four letters are written by Paul to specific Christian
individuals who were working with congregations.
    The letter to the Hebrews was written to help Jewish Christians understand that the Old Testament had fulfilled its
purpose in pointing people to something much better: Christ Jesus.
    The letters of James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, and Jude were all written to Christians in various areas, and the
letters are named after the writer.
    The book of Revelation is a combination of letters from Christ Jesus to specific congregations, and a prophecy given
as a reminder to Christians to stay faithful even in persecution because God is the one ultimately in control.}}
                                               {{ Introduction to Romans 58 AD
    The Romans had their problems with Jewish Christian false teachers also. But he first addressed homosexuality which
was a common practice in Rome at the time. Caesar Nero was a classic example. Paul puts it in blunt terms in 1 Cor. 6:9,
‘they will not inherit the kingdom of God.’ In the next few chapters, Paul deals with: various quotes of the O.T., why they
are not the ‘faith of Abraham,’ and that Christ was the fulfilment of that promise to Abraham, long before the O.T. was
written. In chapter 6, Paul gives us one more aspect about immersion, the death burial, and resurrection, same as our
Lord. Chapter 7 shows the contrast of a married couple and remarriage, but the whole point is you cannot keep the Old
Covenant of God and be married to the New Covenant of Jesus or else God calls you an adulteress. Paul speaks of his
(and our) war between what we want to do vs. what we are to do in Christ and how nothing but ourselves can ever keep
us the love of God. Chapter 9 goes back to the argument against the Jewish false* teachers. In 10, the same problem with
the Israel of then and many false religious groups of today, ‘a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.’ Then Paul
speaks of the declarations/report from the apostles that brought them to Christ. In 11, Paul speaks that is was always
God’s plan to have the Gentiles and Jews under one covenant. In Chapters 12-14, instructions on how to live as a
Christian, and governments in Chapter 13. In Chapter15 back to more about the Law of Moses vs. the Law of Christ.
Ending with Paul’s typical farewells.}}

spirit of holiness, out-of the resurrection of the dead), Jesus Christ our Lord. 1:5 Through whom, we

Rome, beloved of God, called holy-ones: grace to you° and peace from God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ.
    1:8
         First indeed, I am giving-thanks to my God through Jesus Christ on behalf of all of you°, that
your faith is proclaimed in the whole world. 1:9 For* God is my witness, to whom I am giving-divine-
       °
service in my spirit in the good-news of his Son, as I constantly make* a remembrance of you°. 1:10
I am beseeching God always in my prayers, if somehow now, I will be prospered in the will of God
to come to you° someday, 1:11 for* I am longing to see you°, in-order-that I may give to you° some
spiritual gift*, *that* you° may be established; 1:12 and this is my prayer to be encouraged together
among you°, through the faith in one another, both yours° and mine. 1:13 Now brethren, I do not wish
you° to be ignorant that I often purposed to come to you° (and I was prevented till presently), in-
order-that I might also have some fruit among you°, just-as among the rest of the Gentiles. 1:14 I am
a debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. 1:15 So, as in me, I am
eager to proclaim the good-news to you° also who are in Rome.
    1:16
         For* I am not ashamed of the good-news of the Christ; for* it is the power of God *for salvation
to everyone who believes, both to the Jew first and to the Greek. 1:17 For* the righteousness of God
is revealed from faith to {Or: into} faith in it; just-as it has been written, ‘But the righteous will be
living from faith.’ {Hab. 2:4}
    1:18
          For* the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
men and upon the ones holding back the truth in unrighteousness, 1:19 because what is known of God
is apparent among them, for* God manifested it to them. 1:20 For* the invisible things of him are
clearly seen from the creation of the world, being perceived by the things-made, both his eternal
power and divinity, *that* they may be without defense, 1:21 because having known God, they did not
glorify him as God, or gave-thanks to him, but became-futile in their reasonings and their heart was
darkened without understanding. 1:22 They were foolish, claiming to be wise, 1:23 and changed the
glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and of
four-footed mammals and of reptiles.
    1:24
          Hence also, God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts into uncleanness, to dishonor their
bodies among themselves. 1:25 They exchanged the truth of God into the lie and worshiped and gave-
divine-service to the created thing contrary to the one who created it, who is gracious* forever.

braggarts, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 1:31 without understanding, covenant-
breakers, cold-hearted, unappeasable and unmerciful. 1:32 Who, having fully known the ordinance

     2:1
         Hence O man, you are without defense, everyone who judges; for* in what you are judging the
other, you are condemning yourself, for* you who judge are practicing the same things. 2:2 Now we
know that the judgment of God is according-to truth upon the ones who practice such things. 2:3 Now
O man, who is judging the ones who practice such things and you are doing* the same things, are
you reasoning this that you will be fleeing away from the judgment of God? 2:4 Or do you despise the
riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, being ignorant that the kindness of God is
leading you to repentance? 2:5 But you store up wrath for yourself according-to your hardness and
unrepentant heart in the day of wrath and of revelation and of the righteous judgment of God, 2:6 who
will ‘repay to each according-to his works,’ {Pro 24:12b, Psa 62:12} 2:7 everlasting life to the ones who
indeed by endurance from good work are seeking glory and honor and incorruption. 2:8 But to the
ones seeking things out-of selfish ambition and who are indeed disobedient to the truth, but obey
unrighteousness, he will repay with fury and wrath, 2:9 affliction and distress upon every soul of man
who is working evil, both of the Jew first and of the Greek. 2:10 But glory and honor and peace to
everyone who is working good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek, 2:11 for* there is no favoritism
with God.
      2:12
           For* as many as sinned without the law will also perish without the law. And as many as
sinned in the law will be judged through the law. 2:13 For* the hearers of the law are not righteous
with God, but the doers of the law will be made righteous. 2:14 For* whenever the Gentiles, not having
the law, practice the things of the law by nature, these, not having the law, are the law to themselves,
2:15
      who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying together-with
their hearts, and between one another, their reasonings are accusing or either defending them, 2:16
in the day when God will be judging the secrets of men through Jesus Christ, according-to my
teaching of the good-news.
     2:17
           Behold, you who are named a Jew and rest upon the law and boast in God, 2:18 and know God’s
will and approve the things which are carrying more-value, being instructed out-of the law, 2:19 and
have confidence in yourself to be a guide of the blind, a light of the ones in darkness, 2:20 a corrector
of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.
     2:21
          Therefore, the one teaching a different one, are you not teaching yourself? The one preaching
not to steal, are you stealing? 2:22 The one saying to not commit adultery, are you committing
adultery? The one detesting idols, are you a temple looter? 2:23 You who are boasting in the law,
through your transgression of the law, are you dishonoring God? 2:24 ‘For* the name of God is
blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you°,’ just-as it has been written. 2:25 For* circumcision
indeed profits, if you should practice the law, but if you should be a transgressor of the law, your
circumcision has become uncircumcision. {Isa 52:5}
      2:26
            Therefore, if the uncircumcision are observing the ordinances of the law, will his
uncircumcision not be counted toward circumcision? 2:27 And the man from the natural

uncircumcision who is completing the law, will be judging you, who are a transgressor of the law
through the writing {Or: ‘scripture’ meaning ‘scriptures’ also in 2:29, 7:6.} and circumcision. 2:28 For* the one
is not a Jew openly; nor is circumcision the one openly in the flesh, 2:29 but the one is a Jew in the
secret thing, and the circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in the writing; whose praise is not from
men, but from God.

     3:1
         Therefore, what is the supremacy of the Jew? Or what is the profit of circumcision? 3:2 Much,
according-to every manner! For* indeed, first, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God. 3:3
For* what if some disbelieved? Their unbelief will be not doing-away-with the faithfulness of God,
will it? 3:4 Let it not happen! Now, let God become true*, but every man a liar, just-as it has been
written, ‘*That you should be made righteous in your words and may overcome while* you were
being judged.’ {Psa 51:4} 3:5 But if our unrighteousness is establishing the righteousness of God, what
will we say? The God who brings upon us wrath is not unrighteous, is he? (I speak according-to the
manner of man.) 3:6 Let it not happen! Otherwise how will God judge the world?
     3:7
          For* if the truth of God in my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still being judged like
a sinner? 3:8 And not (just-as we are blasphemed and just-as some say us to speak) Let us do* evil
things in-order-that good things should come? Whose condemnation is just!
     3:9
         Therefore, what? Are we Jews special? Certainly not; for* we accused beforehand, both Jews
and Greeks to all be under sin; 3:10 just-as it has been written, ‘There is none righteous, not even one.
3:11
     No one is understanding. No one is seeking out God. 3:12 They all shunned God at the same-time
they were becoming-useless. None is practicing kindness; none is insofar as even one.’ {Psa 14:1-3
& 53:1-3} 3:13 ‘Their throat has been an opened burial chamber; they were being treacherous with their
tongues.’ {Psa 5:9} ‘The poison of the asps is under their lips.’ {Psa 140:3} 3:14 ‘Whose mouth is full
of evil-cursing and bitterness.’ {Psa 10:7?} 3:15 ‘Their feet are swift to shed blood; 3:16 downfall and
misery is in their ways; 3:17 and they did not know the way of peace.’ {Isa 59:7,8} 3:18 ‘There is no fear
of God in front of their eyes.’ {Psa 36:1}
     3:19
           Now we know that as many things as the law says, it is speaking to the ones in the law; in-
order-that every mouth may be sealed and all the world may become under a sentence to God; 3:20
because every flesh will not be made righteous in his sight from the works of the law; for* through
the law comes the full knowledge of sin.
     3:21
          But now the righteousness of God has been manifested separate from the law, being witnessed
by the law and the prophets; 3:22 even the righteousness of God through faith of Jesus Christ toward
all and upon all the ones who believe; for* there is no distinction; 3:23 for* all have sinned and come-
short of the glory of God. 3:24 All those who believe, being freely made righteous in his grace, through
the redemption, the one which is in Christ Jesus, 3:25 whom God purposed as an atonement through
the faith in his blood in an example of his righteousness, because of the passing-over of the sins,
having happened beforehand 3:26 (in the forbearance of God), even toward the example of his
righteousness in the current time, *that* he may himself be righteous and who is making righteous
the one from the faith of Jesus.

    3:27
          Therefore, where is the boasting? It was locked out. Through what law? Of works? No, but
through the law of faith. 3:28 Therefore, we are reasoning for a man to be made righteous in faith
separate from the works of the law. 3:29 Or is God the God of Jews only and not the God of Gentiles
also? Yes, of Gentiles also. 3:30 Since God is one, it is he who will be making righteous the
circumcision out-of faith and the uncircumcision through the faith. 3:31 Therefore, do we do-away-
with the law through the faith? Let it not happen! But through the faith, we are establishing the law.

    4:1
        Therefore, what will we say, that Abraham, our father, according-to the flesh, to have found?
4:2
    For* if Abraham was made righteous out-of works, he has grounds for boasting, but not toward
God. 4:3 For* what does the Scripture say? ‘And Abraham believed God and it was counted to him
*
  for righteousness.’ {Gen 15:6} 4:4 Now to the one who is working, the reward is not counted
according-to favor, but according-to debt. 4:5 But to the one who is not working, but believes upon
the one who makes righteous the ungodly, his faith is counted toward righteousness. 4:6 Just-as David
also says concerning the good-fortune of the man to whom God counts righteousness separate from
works, 4:7 saying, ‘Those whose lawlessnesses were forgiven and whose sins were covered are
fortunate. 4:8 The man to whom the Lord should never count sin, is fortunate.’ {Psa 32:1,2} 4:9
Therefore, is this good-fortune upon the circumcision or also upon the uncircumcision? For* we say
that his faith was counted to Abraham *for righteousness. 4:10 Therefore, how was it counted? While
being in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 4:11 And he
received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith of which he had in the
uncircumcision, *that* he himself may be the father of all the ones who believe, even through
uncircumcision, *that* righteousness may also be counted to them; {Gen 17:10} 4:12 and the father of
circumcision, to the ones not only from the circumcision, but to the ones who also are marching in
the footprints of the faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.
     4:13
          For* the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, for him to be heir of the world, but not
through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 4:14 For* if the ones from the law are heirs,
the faith has been made void and the promise has been done-away-with. 4:15 For* the law is working
wrath; for* where there is no law, neither is there transgression. 4:16 Because of this, it is from faith,
in-order-that it may be according-to grace; *that* the promise may be steadfast to all the seed; not to
the one from the law only, but also to the one which is from the faith of Abraham, who is the father
of us all 4:17 (as it has been written, ‘I have placed you as a father of many nations’ {Gen 17:5}), in
front of God, the one whom he believed, who is giving-life to the dead and is calling the things
which are not, as though they are. 4:18 Abraham who contrary to hope believed upon hope, *that* he
himself may become a father of many nations, according-to what had been spoken, So your seed will
be. {Gen 15:5}
    4:19
          And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (being* nearly a
hundred years), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. 4:20 But he did not doubt in unbelief at the
promise of God, but was empowered in the faith, having given glory to God, 4:21 and having been
fully assured that what he has promised, he is able also to do*. 4:22 Hence it was also counted to him
*
  for righteousness. 4:23 Now it was not written, ‘It was counted to him,’ because of him only, 4:24 but
also, because of us to whom it is about to be counted, who believe upon the one who raised up Jesus
our Lord from the dead, 4:25 who was given up because of our trespasses and was raised up because

     5:1
          Therefore, having been made righteous from faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord
Jesus Christ, 5:2 through whom we also have had the access to this grace in the faith in which we are
standing, and we are boasting in hope of the glory of God. 5:3 But not only in this, but we are also
boasting in the afflictions, knowing that affliction is working endurance; 5:4 and endurance, approved
character; and an approved character, hope; 5:5 and hope does not shame one, because the love* of
God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
     5:6
          For* our still being in a weak state, according-to the proper time, Christ died on behalf of the
ungodly. 5:7 For* scarcely will one die on behalf of a righteous person; for* perhaps someone might
even dare to die on behalf of the good person. 5:8 But God is establishing his own love* toward us,
that our still being in a sinful state, Christ died on our behalf. 5:9 Therefore, much more, having now
been made righteous in his blood, we will be saved from the wrath of God through him. 5:10 For* if
while being enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, having
been reconciled, we will be saved in his life; 5:11 and not only so, but we are also boasting in God
through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
     5:12
           Because of this, just-like sin entered into the world through one man and death through sin,
and thus death went throughout into all men, upon which all have sinned. 5:13 For* sin was in the
world till the law, but sin is not charged to one’s account when there is no law. 5:14 But death reigned
from Adam till Moses, even upon the ones who have not sinned upon the likeness of the
transgression of Adam, who is a pattern of the future one. 5:15 But not like the trespass, so also is the
gift*. For* if the many died by the trespass of the one, the favor of God and the gift by the favor of
the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded much more to the many. 5:16 And the gift is not as through one
who sinned; for* indeed the judgment came from one into condemnation, but the gift* came from
many trespasses into an act of righteousness. 5:17 For* if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned
through the one, much more they, who are receiving the abundance of the favor and of the gift of
righteousness, will be reigning in life through the one, who is Jesus Christ.
      5:18
            Therefore, consequently*, as through one trespass the judgment came to all men to
condemnation; so through the righteousness of one man the gift also came to all men into
justification of life. 5:19 For* just-like the many were designated as sinners through the one man’s
disobedience*, so also the many will be designated as righteous through the obedience of the one.
5:20
     But the law entered in beside us in-order-that the trespass might increase, but where sin increased,
the favor {Or:: grace} over-abounded, 5:21 in-order-that, just-like sin reigned in death, so also the favor
might reign through righteousness to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

           Therefore, what will we say? Are we remaining in sin in-order-that grace {Or: favor; and so
elsewhere in the letters to the congregations} may increase? 6:2 Let it not happen! We who died to sin, how
will we still be living in it? 6:3 Or are you° ignorant that as many as were immersed* into Christ Jesus
were immersed* into his death? 6:4 Therefore, we were buried together-with him through the

immersion* into his death, in-order-that just-like Christ was raised up from the dead through the
glory of the Father, so we might also walk in newness of life. 6:5 For* if we have become unified
together-with him in the likeness of his death, but also, we will be unified with him in the likeness
of the resurrection. 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man was crucified together-with him, in-order-that
the body of sin might be done-away, no longer for us to be enslaved to sin, 6:7 for* he who died has
been made righteous away from sin. 6:8 But if we died together-with Christ, we believe that we will
also be living together-with him, 6:9 knowing that Christ having been raised up from the dead dies
no more; death has no more lordship over him. 6:10 For* what death that he died to sin, he died to sin
once for all, but what life that he lives, he is living to God. 6:11 So you° also, count° yourselves to be
indeed dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

          Therefore, do not let sin reign in your° mortal body, *that* you° may obey* it in its lusts, 6:13 nor
present° your° members as weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but present° yourselves to God, as
living from the dead and your° members as weapons of righteousness to God. 6:14 For* sin will not
have lordship over you°, for* you° are not under the law, but under grace. 6:15 Therefore, what? Will
we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? Let it not happen! 6:16 Do you° not know,
that to what you° present yourselves as bondservants to obedience, you° are the bondservants to what
you° obey*, either of sin to death or of obedience to righteousness? 6:17 But gratitude is to God, that,
though you° were bondservants of sin, but you° obeyed* from the heart the pattern {Or: example; 6:3-6}
of teaching to which you° were given, 6:18 and having been made free from sin, you° were enslaved
to righteousness.
     6:19
          I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your° flesh, for* just-like you° presented
your° members as bondservants to uncleanness and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so
now present° your° members as bondservants to righteousness leading to holiness. 6:20 For* when you°
were bondservants of sin, you° were free in regard to the righteousness. 6:21 Therefore, what fruit
were you° having then in which things you° are now ashamed? For* the end of those things is death.
6:22
     But now, having been made free from sin and having been enslaved to God, you° have your° fruit
leading to holiness and the end everlasting life. 6:23 For* the compensations of sin is death, but the

         Or are you° ignorant, brethren (for* I am speaking to those knowing the law), that the law has
lordship over a man inasmuch time as he is living? 7:2 For* the woman in wedlock has been bound
by the law to the living husband, but if the husband dies, she has been done-away-with {i.e.,
discharged} from the law of the husband. 7:3 Therefore, consequently*, if the husband is living, if she
becomes joined to a different man, she will be divinely-called, an adulteress. But if the husband dies,
she is free from the law, for her not to be an adulteress, even if she had become joined to a different
man.

        Therefore, what will we say? Is the law sin? Let it not happen! But, I did not know sin, except
through the law; for* I also did not know lusting {O.T. desire (but with an object) and elsewhere}, except
that the law was saying, Do not lust. {Exo 20:17} 7:8 But sin, having taken a starting-point, worked
in me through the commandment all manner of lust; for* separate from the law sin is dead. 7:9 But
I was previously living separate from the law, but when the commandment came, sin lived again
through me and I died, 7:10 and the commandment, the one to be into life, this one was found in me
to be into death; 7:11 for* sin, having taken a starting-point through the commandment, deceived me
and through it, it killed me. 7:12 So-then the law indeed is holy and the commandment holy and
righteous and good. 7:13 Therefore, what is the good thing to me, has it become death? Let it not
happen! But sin, in-order-that it might appear as sin, through what is the good thing to me, was
working death; in-order-that sin might become a surpassingly-better sinner through the
commandment. 7:14 For* we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, having been sold* under
sin.
    7:15
         For* I do not know what I am working. For* I am practicing this thing which I do not will but
instead I am doing* this thing which I am hating. 7:16 But if I am doing* this thing which I do not
will, I acknowledge together-with the law, that it is good. 7:17 But now I no longer am working it, but
the sin dwelling in me. 7:18 For* I know that what is a good thing is not dwelling in me (this is: in my
flesh); for* it is laying beside me to will it, but I am not finding what is a good thing to work it. 7:19
For* I am not doing* the good thing which I will, but instead I am practicing this evil thing which
I do not will. 7:20 But if I am doing* this thing which I do not will, I am no longer working it, but the
sin dwelling in me. 7:21 Consequently*, I find the law to me the one willing to do* the good thing, that
evil is laying beside me.
    7:22
         For* I delight-inwardly in the law of God according-to the inward man. 7:23 But I am seeing a
different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and capturing me in the law of sin,
the one being in my members. 7:24 O I am a miserable man! Who will rescue me out-of the body of
this death? 7:25 I am giving-thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, consequently*,
I myself, indeed, serve* the law of God in the mind, but I serve* the law of sin in the flesh.

Christ Jesus made me free away from the law of sin and of death. 8:3 For* the law being powerless,
in what it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh
and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, 8:4 in-order-that the ordinance of the law might be

        Therefore, consequently*, brethren, we are debtors but not to the flesh, not to live according-to
the flesh, 8:13 for* if you° are living according-to the flesh, you° are about to die, but if you° slay the
practices of the body in spirit, you° will be living. 8:14 For* as many as are led in the Spirit of God,
these are sons of God. 8:15 For* you° did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you°
received the spirit of sonship, in which we cry, Abba, Father. 8:16 The Spirit himself is testifying
together-with our spirit, that we are children of God; 8:17 and if children, also heirs, heirs indeed of
God and joint heirs of Christ, if indeed* we are suffering together-with him, in-order-that we might
also be glorified together-with him.
   8:18
         For* I reason that the sufferings of the current time are not worthy of comparison to the glory
which is about to be revealed to us. 8:19 For* the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the
revelation of the sons of God. 8:20 For* the creation was subjected to futility, not voluntarily, but
because of the one who subjected it, in hope 8:21 that even the creation itself will be made free away
from the bondage of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. 8:22 For* we
know that all creation groans and travails together in pain till now. 8:23 But not only they, but we
ourselves also who have the first-fruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves are groaning in ourselves,
waiting for our sonship, that is, the redemption of our body. 8:24 For* we were saved in the hope; but
hope which is seen, is not hope; for* why does anyone even hope for what he sees? 8:25 But if we hope
for what we do not see, then we are waiting for it through endurance.
   8:26
         Now likewise*, the Spirit is also jointly helping our weaknesses; for* we do not know what we
will be praying for, that is according-to what is essential for us; but the Spirit himself is petitioning
on our behalf with unspeakable groans; 8:27 and the one searching the hearts knows what is the
mindset of the Spirit, because he is petitioning on behalf of the holy-ones according-to the will of
God. 8:28 Now we know {F} that all things work together toward good, to the ones who love* God, to
the ones who are the invited ones according-to his purpose. 8:29 Because, whom he knew beforehand,
he also determined beforehand, one transformed to the image of his Son, *that* he himself might be
the firstborn among many brethren; 8:30 and whom he determined beforehand, he also invited these
and whom he invited, he also made these righteous and whom he made righteous, he also glorified
these.
   8:31
         Therefore, what will we say to these things? If God is working on our behalf, who is against
us? 8:32 Yet, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all, how will he not
also be granting to us all things together-with him? 8:33 Who will accuse anything against God’s
chosen? It is God who makes one righteous. 8:34 Who is the one who condemns? Christ is the one
who died, but rather, who was also raised up from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who
also is petitioning on our behalf.
    8:35
          Who will be separating us away from the love* of Christ? Will affliction or distress or
persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? 8:36 Just-as it has been written, ‘Because of you


mlvbible.org                                                                                                      245
we are slain the whole day. We were counted as sheep of the slaughter.’ {Psa 44:22} 8:37 But we are
victorious in all these things through the one who loved* us. 8:38 For* I have confidence, that neither
death, nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor powers, nor present things, nor future things,
8:39
     nor height, nor depth, nor some other created thing, will be able to separate us away from the
love* of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

     9:1
          I say the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience is testifying together-with me in the
Holy Spirit, 9:2 that great sorrow is in me and constant anguish in my heart. 9:3 For* I was praying for
myself to be accursed from the Christ on behalf of my brethren, my relatives according-to the flesh,
9:4
    who are Israelites, whose is the sonship and the glory and the covenants* and the institution of the
law and the divine-service and the promises; 9:5 whose are the fathers and from whom is the Christ
according-to the flesh, the one being over all; God is gracious* forever. Amen.
     9:6
         But it is not such-as that the word of God has fallen short. For* all the ones from Israel, these
are not Israel; 9:7 neither are they all children, because they are Abraham’s seed, but instead, ‘Seed
will be called to you in Isaac.’ {Gen 21:12} 9:8 This thing is, the children of the flesh, these are not
children of God, but the children of the promise is counted toward a seed. 9:9 For* this is the word of
promise, ‘I will come according-to this season and Sarah will be with a son.’ {Gen 18:10} 9:10 Now not
only so, but also Rebecca having an impregnation from one man, our father Isaac; 9:11 (for* the
children were not yet born, nor had practiced anything good or evil, in-order-that the purpose of
God according-to his choice might abide, not from works, but from the one who is calling). 9:12 It was
said to her, ‘The greater will be serving* the inferior.’ {Gen 25:23} 9:13 Just-as it has been written,
‘Jacob I loved*, but Esau I hated.’ {Mal 1:2,3}
     9:14
           Therefore, what will we say? There is no unrighteousness with God, is there? Let it not
happen! 9:15 For* he says to Moses, ‘I will show-mercy on whomever I show-mercy and I will have
pity on whomever I have pity.’ {Exo 33:19} 9:16 Therefore, consequently*, it is not from the one who
wills, nor from the one who runs, but from God, the one who shows-mercy. 9:17 For* the Scripture
says to Pharaoh, ‘I lifted you up *for this same thing, *that I myself might show in you my power and
*
  that my name might be thoroughly proclaimed in all the earth.’ {Exo 9:16} 9:18 Therefore,
consequently*, he shows-mercy on whom he wills and he hardens whom he wills.
     9:19
           Therefore, you will say to me, Why is he still finding-fault? For* who is standing against his
         9:20
will? But-rather, O man, who are you who answers back against God? The molded thing will not
say to the one who molded it, why have you made* me so, will it? {Isa 45:9?} 9:21 Or does the potter
not have authority over the clay, to make* out-of the same batch one vessel what is *for honor and
what is *for dishonor? 9:22 But what if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known,
carried vessels of wrath in much patience having been framed *for destruction; 9:23 and in-order-that
he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand

    9:25
          As he also says in Hosea, ‘I will be calling the people who are not my people, my people, and
she who is not beloved, beloved.’{Ho. 2:23} 9:26 And it will be, in the place where it was said to them,
‘You° are not my people; they will be called sons of the living God there.’ {Ho. 1:10} 9:27 Now Isaiah
cries on behalf of Israel, ‘If the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea, only the
remnant will be saved; 9:28 for* he is completing and cutting-short the word in righteousness because
having been cut-short, the Lord will make* the word upon the earth.’ {Isa 10:22, 23} 9:29 And, just-as
Isaiah has said beforehand, ‘If the Lord of Hosts did not leave us a seed, we would have become like
Sodom and we would have been similar to Gomorrah.’ {Isa 1:9}
    9:30
          Therefore, what will we say? That the Gentiles, the ones not pursuing righteousness, grabbed
righteousness, but the righteousness from faith. 9:31 But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has
not attained to that law of righteousness. 9:32 Why? Because it was not from the faith, but as it was
from works of the law, for* they stumbled on the stone of stumbling; 9:33 just-as it has been written,
‘Behold, I place a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense in Zion and everyone who believes on
him will not be ashamed.’ {Isa 8:14 & 28:16}
                                              [Romans 10] TOC
     10:1
          Brethren, indeed the delight of my heart and my supplication to God on behalf of Israel {i.e.,
the Jews},    is *for their salvation. 10:2 For* I testify to them that they have a zeal of God, but not
according-to full knowledge. 10:3 For* being ignorant of God’s righteousness and the Israel seeking
to establish its own righteousness, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 10:4
For* Christ is the end of the law *for righteousness to everyone who believes. 10:5 For* Moses writes
about the righteousness from the law, ‘The man who has practiced them will be living in them.’ {Lev
18:5 Ezek. 20:11} 10:6 But the righteousness from faith says thus, ‘You should not say in your heart,
Who will be ascending into heaven?’ (This is: to lead Christ down.) 10:7 Or, ‘Who will be descending
into the abyss?’ (This is: to lead Christ up from among the dead.) 10:8 But what does it say? ‘The
declaration is near you, in your mouth and in your heart.’ {Deu 30:12-14?} This is the declaration of
the faith which we are preaching: 10:9 that if you confess the Lord Jesus in your mouth and if you
believe in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved; 10:10 for* it is believed
in the heart toward righteousness and it is confessed with the mouth toward salvation. 10:11 For* the
Scripture says, ‘Everyone who believes upon him will not be ashamed.’ {Isa 28:16} 10:12 For* there is
no distinction between both Jew and Greek, for* the same Lord is Lord of all, rich toward all who
are calling upon him, 10:13 for* everyone, ‘Whomever calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.’
{Joel 2:32, Acts 2:21} 10:14 Therefore, how will they call upon him in whom they did not believe? But
how will they believe of whom they did not hear? But how will they hear without someone
preaching? 10:15 But how will they preach, if they should not be sent? Just-as it has been written,
‘How Beautiful are the feet of the ones proclaiming the good-news of peace and of the ones
proclaiming the good-news of good things!’ {Isa 52:7}
    10:16
          But not all obeyed* the good-news; for* Isaiah says, ‘Lord, who believed our report?’ {Isa 53:1}
10:17
      Consequently*, the faith comes from our report but our report comes through the declaration of
God. 10:18 But I am saying, ‘Did they not hear?’ But-rather, ‘Their sound went forth into all the earth
and their declarations to the limits of the inhabited-earth.’ {Psa 19:4} 10:19 But I am saying, Did Israel

not know? First Moses says, ‘I will provoke you° to jealousy upon what is no nation. I will rouse you°
to anger upon a nation which has no understanding.’ {Deu 32:21} 10:20 Now Isaiah is very daring and
says, ‘I was found by the ones not seeking me. I became manifest to the ones not asking for me.’ {Isa
65:1} 10:21 But he says to Israel, ‘The whole day, I outstretched my hands to a disobedient and
contradicting people.’ {Isa 65:2}
                                              [Romans 11] TOC
    11:1
          Therefore, I say, God did not shove away his people, did he? Let it not happen! For* I am also
an Israelite, from the seed of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. {Psa 94:14} 11:2 God did not shove
away his people which he knew beforehand. Or do you° not know what the Scripture says in regard
to Elijah? How he petitions God against Israel, saying, 11:3 ‘Lord, they killed your prophets and made
ruins of your altars, and I was left alone and they are seeking my life.’ {1Ki. 19:10,14} 11:4 But what
does the divine-answer say to him? ‘I left to myself seven thousand men, who did not bow the knee
to Baal.’ {1Ki. 19:18} 11:5 Therefore, so a remnant has also become according-to the chosen of grace
in the current time. 11:6 But if it is by grace, it is no more from works, otherwise grace becomes grace
no more. But if it is from works, no more is it grace; otherwise work is work no more. 11:7 Therefore,
what? What Israel is seeking after, it has not obtained this, but the chosen obtained it and the rest
were hardened, 11:8 just-as it has been written, ‘God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes not able to see
and ears not able to hear, until this very day.’ {Isa 29:10, 6:9} 11:9 And David says, ‘Let their table
become *for a snare and *for a trap and *for an offense and *for a repayment to them. 11:10 Let° their
eyes be darkened not to see and bend their back always.’{Psa 69:22-23}
     11:11
           Therefore, I say, They did not trip in-order-that they might fall, did they? Let it not happen!
But salvation has come to the Gentiles in their trespass, *that* they might provoke them to jealousy.
11:12
      Now if their trespass is the riches of the world and their loss is the riches of the Gentiles; how-
much more is their fullness? 11:13 For* I speak to you°, the Gentiles, inasmuch as I am indeed an
apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my service, 11:14 if somehow I provoke to jealousy the ones who are my
flesh and might save some out-of them. 11:15 For* if the casting away of them is the reconciliation of
the world, what is the receiving of them, except life from the dead?
     11:16
           Now if the first-fruit is holy, also is the batch and if the root is holy, also are the branches.
11:17
      But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive-tree, were grafted in
among them and became a fellow partner of the root and of the plumpness of the olive-tree, 11:18 do
not boast against the branches. But if you are boasting against them, you are not bearing the root, but
the root bears you. 11:19 Therefore, you will say, Branches were broken off in-order-that I might be
grafted in. 11:20 Well; they were broken off in their unbelief but you are standing in the faith. Do not
be cavalier, but fear; 11:21 for* if God did not spare what is according-to nature {i.e., natural} branches;
lest he will neither be sparing you. 11:22 Therefore, behold the kindness and severity of God, indeed
severity upon the ones who fell short, but kindness upon you, if you should remain in the kindness
of God; otherwise you also will be cut off. 11:23 But also those will be grafted in, if they should not
remain in their unbelief, for* God is able to graft them in again. 11:24 For* if you were cut off from
what is according-to nature a wild olive-tree and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive-
tree, how-much more these, the ones according-to nature, will be grafted into their own olive-tree?

           For* brethren, I do not wish you° to be ignorant of this mystery (that* you° may not be too
prudent with yourselves), that a hardening has happened partially to Israel, till the fullness of the
Gentiles should enter.
    11:26
           And thus all Israel will be saved, just-as it has been written, ‘He who rescues will come out-of
Zion, and he will turn away various ungodlinesses from Jacob. 11:27 And this is my covenant* with
them, whenever I take away their sins.’ {Isa 59:20-21, 27:9} 11:28 According-to the good-news they are
indeed enemies because of you°, but according-to the choice, they are beloved because of the fathers.
11:29
       For* the gifts* and the calling {Or: invitation; and in all other instances in the MLV} of God are
unregretted. 11:30 For* just-like you° were also previously disobedient to God, but now you° were
shown-mercy by the disobedience of these, 11:31 so now these also were disobedient in your° mercy,
in-order-that they themselves might also be shown-mercy. 11:32 For* God locked up all together in
disobedience in-order-that he might show-mercy upon all.
     11:33
           O the depth of the riches, and of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable
are his judgments and untraceable his ways! 11:34 For* who knew the mind of the Lord? Or who has
become his counselor? {Isa 40:13} 11:35 Or who first-gave to him and it will be repaid to him again?

     14:13
           Therefore, we should no longer judge° one another, but rather judge this: you are not to place
a stumbling block, or offense, in the way of the brother. 14:14 I know, and have confidence in the Lord
Jesus, that nothing is desecrated through itself, except to the one counting something to be
desecrated, to that one it is desecrated. 14:15 But if your brother is made sorrowful because of food,
you are no longer walking according-to love*. Do not destroy that man, on behalf of whom Christ
died, with your food. 14:16 Therefore, do not let your° good thing be blasphemed; 14:17 for* the kingdom
of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 14:18 For* the one
who is serving* Christ in these things is well pleasing to God and approved by men. 14:19 Therefore,
consequently*, we may pursue the things of peace, and the things from the building up of the
kingdom *for one another. 14:20 Do not tear-down the work of God because of food. All things indeed
are clean, but it is evil to the man who eats through a stumbling block. 14:21 It is good not to eat
meats, nor to drink wine, nor anything in which your brother stumbles or is offended or is weak. 14:22
Do you have faith? Have it to yourself in God’s sight! The fortunate one is not judging himself in
what he is approving. 14:23 But the one doubting has been condemned if he eats, because he does not
eat out-of faith, and everything which is not from faith is sin.
     14:24
           Now to the one who is able to establish you° according-to my good-news, and the preaching
of Jesus Christ, according-to the revelation of the mystery, having been kept-silent in times
everlasting, 14:25 but now, having been manifested, and through the prophetic Scriptures, according-to
the commandment of the everlasting God, was made known to all the nations, into the obedience of
the faith; 14:26 to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, in whom is the glory forever. Amen.

     15:1
          Now we, the able, ought to bear the weaknesses of the powerless and not to please ourselves.
15:2
     Let each of us please his neighbor *for what is the good thing toward building him up. 15:3 For*
also Christ did not please himself, but, as it has been written, ‘The reproaches of the ones
reproaching you fell upon me.’ {Psa 69:9} 15:4 For* as many things as were written beforehand were
written beforehand *for our instruction in-order-that through the endurance and through the
encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. 15:5 Now may the God of the endurance and
the encouragement give to you° to be mindful of the same thing among one another according-to

Christ Jesus, 15:6 in-order-that you° may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ united
with* one mouth.
   15:7
        Hence receive° for yourselves one another, just-as Christ also received you°, to the glory of
God. 15:8 But I am saying Christ Jesus has become a servant of the circumcision on behalf of the truth
of God, *that* he might confirm the promises given to the fathers, 15:9 and that the Gentiles are to
glorify God on behalf of his mercy; as it has been written, ‘Because of this, I will profess you among
the Gentiles and sing-praise to your name.’ {Psa 18:49} 15:10 And again he says, ‘Gentiles be° joyous
with his people.’ {Deu 32:43} 15:11 And again, ‘Praise° the Lord, all the Gentiles, and praise° him all
the peoples.’ {Psa 117:1} 15:12 And again, Isaiah says, ‘There will be the root of Jesse and he who was
raised* up to rule over the Gentiles; upon him the Gentiles will hope.’ {Isa 11:1, 10} 15:13 Now the God
of hope may fill you° from all joy and peace while* you° have believed, *that* you° may abound in
hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    15:14
          And my brethren, I myself also have confidence concerning you°, that you° yourselves are full
of goodness, having been filled with all knowledge, being able also to admonish others. 15:15 But I
wrote more-daringly to you° brethren individually, as reminding you° again, because of the grace
which was given to me by God, 15:16 *that* I might be a minister* of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
performing the sacred work of the good-news of God, in-order-that the offering from the Gentiles
might become acceptable, having been made holy in the Holy Spirit.
    15:17
          Therefore, I have my boasting in Christ Jesus in the things pertaining to God. 15:18 For* I will
not dare to speak of anything of the things which Christ has not worked through me, except *for the
obedience of the Gentiles, in word and in work, 15:19 in the power of signs and wonders, in the power
of the Spirit of God, so-then, as for me to have fulfilled the good-news of the Christ from Jerusalem
and in a circle, as far as Illyricum. 15:20 And so, I am making it my aim to proclaim the good-news,
not where Christ was already named, in-order-that I may not build upon another’s foundation, 15:21
but, as it has been written, ‘They will see, to whom it was not reported concerning him and those
who have not heard, they will understand.’ {Isa 52:15}
    15:22
          Hence also, I was being hindered by the many things of the time to come to you°, 15:23 but now,
having no longer a place in these districts and having a longing to come to you° from many years
ago, 15:24 as I should travel through toward Spain, I will be coming to you° (for* I am hoping to see
you° while I am traveling through and to be sent onward from there by you°, if first I may be partially
filled from you°). 15:25 But now, I am traveling to Jerusalem, serving the holy-ones. 15:26 For*
Macedonia and Achaia were delighted to make* a certain generosity to the poor of the holy-ones in
Jerusalem. 15:27 For* they were delighted and they are their debtors. For* if the Gentiles shared in the
spiritual things of them, they owe it to them also to minister* to them in the fleshly things. 15:28
Therefore, having completed this thing and having sealed this fruit for them, I will be going away
into Spain through you°. 15:29 Now I know while coming to you°, I will be coming in the fullness of
the blessing of the good-news of the Christ.
    15:30
          Now brethren, I am encouraging you° through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love* of
the Spirit, to struggle together-with me, and on my behalf in the prayers to God from you°; 15:31 in-
order-that I might be rescued away from the ones who are disobedient in Judea and in-order-that my
service, the one I have *for Jerusalem might become acceptable to the holy-ones, 15:32 in-order-that

                                            {{ Introduction to 1 Corinthians 56-58 AD
    If you could find a place where sin was rampant, it was Corinth. Then what was worse is the attitude common to today
of ‘it really doesn’t matter.’ The more garbage you take in, the more chance of it influencing you! Then the congregation
in Corinth seems to take everything to the extreme.
    They were not unified in much of anything and filled full of splits, and the ‘anything goes’ policy so common to many
religious groups of today. ‘In the same...’ ‘be mindful of the same...’ is a common commandment throughout all the
letters; but not in this congregation. Paul’s use of sarcasm is superior throughout both Corinthian letters, ‘Christ sent me
not to immerse, but to proclaim the good-news’ actually both are commands of the Lord written at the ends of the books
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, witnessed in Acts 2:38 ‘to be saved.’ Man’s foolishness is used by God to promote His purpose.
4:10, apostles are foolish, but they (the Corinthians) are wise, and many more places.
    Then in chapter 2, Paul goes from foolishness of man to wisdom of man vs. God’s wisdom, which progresses onward
to the spiritual things. Chapter 3, Paul calls them babies and fleshly. Then he talks about the foundation (Jesus) that he
and Apollos built that they should make sure they build properly on it. Because even if Paul’s work fails at judgment day
(the Corinthians); Paul is still saved as though he walked through the fire. In chapter 4 & 9, Paul calls them arrogant, they
are judging him. They have everything, even reigning like kings; they do not need Paul. In chapter 5, a man is fornicating
with his stepmother. Instead of disciplining him, so he would not spend eternity away from them; they just do not care.
This ‘leavening’ could ruin the batch of them, and they just do not get it. Then they have lawsuits against each other. Paul
finally lists all of their past sins (possibly current ones) and tells them no one who practices them will inherit heaven. The
Corinthians thought you could be like the world and still be in the Lord’s body at the same time. Chapter 7 deals with
marriage and the unmarried. Then in Chapters 8, 10, they add idolatry to the list. Also in Chapters 10, 11 it was pointed
out how they are abusing the Lord’s Supper and the love feast versus how it should be respected. We know from Acts
20:7, this is one of the reasons the congregations come together every Sunday. Chapters 12, 13, 14 talks about the
spiritual gifts Christians had during the first century used to evangelize the world (Mark 16:15-20). In 13:10, he tells
them the completed word will stop all of this, so put love higher on the list, it never fails. Once again, the Corinthians
took this to extremes as about everything else they did. In 15, Adam and Jesus are compared, and the last part talks about
the time when Jesus will come back where ‘in the blink of an eye’ we will inherit our heavenly bodies. In 16, he
concludes with his typical greetings and encouragements.}}

     1:1
         Paul, a called apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother, 1:2 to
the congregation* of God, she who is in Corinth, those having been made holy in Christ Jesus, to the
called ones, holy-ones, together-with all the ones calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in
every place, both theirs and ours: 1:3 grace to you° and peace from God our Father and Lord Jesus
Christ.
     1:4
         I am always giving-thanks to my God concerning you°, on the basis of the grace of God which
was given to you° in Christ Jesus; 1:5 that you° were enriched in him in everything, in all speech and
all knowledge; 1:6 just-as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you°; 1:7 so-then for you° to lack
in no gift*; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1:8 who will also confirm you° until
the end, as irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1:9 God is faithful, through whom you°
were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
     1:10
          Now brethren, I am pleading with you° through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in-order-that
you all should speak the same thing and there should be no splits among you°, but you° should have
      °
been framed already in the same mind and in the same viewpoint. 1:11 For* it was indicated to me
concerning you°, my brethren, by the household of Chloe, that strifes are among you°. 1:12 Now I am
saying this, that each of you° says, I am indeed of Paul! But I am indeed of Apollos! But I am indeed
of Cephas! But I am indeed of Christ!

     1:13
           Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified on your° behalf, was he? Or were you°
immersed* into the name of Paul? 1:14 I give-thanks to God that I immersed* none of you°, except
Crispus and Gaius; {Act 18:8} 1:15 in-order-that not anyone might say that I immersed* you into my
own name. 1:16 And I also immersed* the household of Stephanas; furthermore, I do not know if I
immersed* any other. 1:17 For* Christ sent me not to immerse*, but to proclaim the good-news; not in
wisdom of speech (that* the cross of Christ might not be made void).
     1:18
          For* the account of the cross is indeed foolishness to the ones perishing, but to us who are
saved it is the power of God. 1:19 For* it has been written, ‘I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and
I will reject the understanding of the intelligent ones.’ {Isa 29:14, Psa 33:10} 1:20 Where is the wise?
Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Did God not make the wisdom of the world
foolish? 1:21 For* since, in the wisdom of God the world through the wisdom it had did not know
God, God was delighted through the foolishness of the preaching to save the ones who believe. 1:22
Since both Jews ask for a sign and Greeks seek wisdom; 1:23 but we preach Christ as having been
crucified, indeed an offense to the Jews, but foolishness to the Greeks; 1:24 but to them, the invited
ones, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 1:25 Because the
foolishness of God is wiser than that of men, and the weakness of God is mightier than that of men.
     1:26
          For* you° see the calling brethren, that not many are wise according-to the flesh, not many
mighty, not many noble. 1:27 But God chose the foolish things of the world in-order-that he may
shame the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world in-order-that he may shame the strong;
1:28
     and God chose the ignoble things of the world and the things which have been scorned and the
things which are not in-order-that he might do-away-with the things which are, 1:29 *that every flesh
should not boast in God’s sight. 1:30 But you° are from him, in Christ Jesus, who has become to us
wisdom and righteousness and holiness and redemption from God, 1:31 that*, just-as it has been
written, ‘He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.’ {Jer 9:24}
                                          [1 Corinthians 2] TOC
     2:1
          And brethren, after I came to you° proclaiming the testimony of God to you°, I did not come
according-to superiority of speech or of wisdom. 2:2 For* I decided not to know anything among you°,
except Jesus Christ and this one having been crucified. 2:3 And I happened to be with you° in
weakness and in fear, and in much trembling. 2:4 And my speech and my preaching were not in
persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 2:5 in-order-
that your° faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but be in the power of God.
     2:6
         Now we are speaking wisdom among the mature ones but not a wisdom of this age, nor of the
rulers of this age, who are being done-away-with; 2:7 but we are speaking God’s wisdom in a mystery,
the wisdom which has been hidden, which God determined beforehand, before the ages, *for our
glory. 2:8 It is this mystery which none of the rulers of this age has known, for* if they knew it, they
would not have crucified the Lord of glory; 2:9 but as it has been written, ‘Things which the eye did
not see and the ear did not hear and things which did not come-up in the heart of man, which God
prepared for the ones who love* him.’ {Isa 64:4}
     2:10
          But God revealed them to us through his Spirit, for* the Spirit is searching all things, even the


258                                                                                                            mlvbible.com
depths of God. 2:11 For* who from men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, the
one in him? So also, no one knows the things of God, except the Spirit of God. 2:12 But we did not
receive the spirit of the world, but the {F} Spirit who is from God, in-order-that we might know the
things which were granted to us by God. 2:13 Which things, we also speak, not in the taught words
from human wisdom, but in those taught words from the Holy Spirit, combining together-with
spiritual words, spiritual things.
     {Footnotes: 1Co 2:12, Spirit who, or: spirit that; (meaning just a simple contrast like ‘things of the world, things from
God.’ All punctuation and verse numbering is man-made.)}
      2:14
           Now the physical man is not accepting the things from the Spirit of God; for* they are
foolishness to him, and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually examined. 2:15 But
the spiritual one is indeed examining all things, but he himself is examined by no one. 2:16 For* who
knew the mind of the Lord, who will be lecturing him? But we have the mind of Christ. {Isa 40:13}

     3:1
          And brethren, I was not able to speak to you° as to spiritual people, but as to fleshly ones, as
to infants in Christ. 3:2 I delivered to you° milk to drink and not food, for* you° were not yet able to
eat it. But still you° are not able even now, 3:3 for* you° are still fleshly. For* where there is jealousy
and strife and dissensions among you°, are you° not fleshly, and are you° walking according-to the
manner of man?
     3:4
         For* whenever someone says, I am indeed of Paul, but a different one, I am of Apollos, are you°
not fleshly? 3:5 Therefore, who is Paul? And who is Apollos? But preferably they are servants
through whom you° believed, even as the Lord gave to each. 3:6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God
was causing the growth. 3:7 So-then neither is the one planting anything, nor the one watering, but
God who is causing the growth. 3:8 Now the one planting and the one watering are one, but each one
will be receiving his own reward according-to his own labor. 3:9 For* we are God’s fellow workers.
You° are God’s cultivation, God’s building.
     3:10
           According-to the grace of God which was given to me, I have laid a foundation like a wise
expert-builder, and another is building upon it. But let each one beware how he is building upon it.
3:11
     For* no one is able to lay another foundation beside the one already laying, who is Jesus Christ.
3:12
     But if anyone is building upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, various woods,
grass, straw, 3:13 the work of each one will become apparent. For* the day will indicate it, because it
is revealed in fire, and the fire will test the work of each one, of what sort it is. 3:14 If anyone’s work
remains which he built upon it, he will be receiving a reward. 3:15 If the work of anyone will be
burned, it will be forfeited, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire.
     3:16
           Do you° not know that you° are a temple of God and the Spirit of God is dwelling in you°? 3:17
If anyone corrupts the temple of God, God will have corruption for this one; for* the temple of God
is holy, which you° are.
     3:18
          Let no one deceive himself. If anyone seems to be wise in this age among you°, let him become
foolish, in-order-that he may become wise. 3:19 For* the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God,
for* it has been written, ‘It is he who grabs the wise in their craftiness’; {Job 5:13} 3:20 and again, ‘The

Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are futile.’ {Psa 94:11} 3:21 So-then, let no one boast
in men. For* all things are yours°, 3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or
death, or present things, or future things. All things are yours°, 3:23 and you° are Christ’s, and Christ
is God’s.

     4:1
         So let a man count us as attendants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. 4:2 But
furthermore, what is required in stewards is in-order-that someone should be found faithful. 4:3 But
it is at the least concern to me in-order-that I might be judged by you° or by a human judgment day.
But I am not even judging myself. 4:4 For* I have been conscious of nothing in myself, but I have not
been made righteous in this thing. But he who is judging me is the Lord. 4:5 So-then, do° not judge
anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both be illuminating the hidden
things of darkness and will be manifesting the plans of the hearts, and then the praise will happen
to each from God.
     4:6
         Now brethren, I fashioned these things to myself and Apollos because of you°, in-order-that
      °
you should learn in us not to have a mindset to go beyond what has been written, in-order-that no
one should be arrogant on behalf of one against the other. 4:7 For* who is making you the judge? But
what do you have which you did not receive? But if you also received it, why are you boasting as
having not received it? 4:8 Already you° are being satisfied, already you° were enriched, you° reigned
as kings without us, and for-sure, I wish-that you° had reigned, in-order-that we might also reign
together-with you°. 4:9 For* I am thinking that God showed us, the apostles, to be last, as men doomed
to death, because we became a spectacle to the world, both to messengers and men. 4:10 We are
foolish because of Christ, but you° are prudent in Christ. We are weak, but you° are strong. You° are
glorious, but we are dishonored. 4:11 We are both hungry and thirsty, till the current hour, and are
naked and are battered and are homeless; 4:12 and we are laboring, working with our own hands.
Being reviled, we are speaking well of them; being persecuted, we are tolerating it; 4:13 being
blasphemed, we are encouraging. We became like the scums of the world, the garbage of all things,
even until now.
     4:14
          I am not writing these things to be embarrassing you°, but I am admonishing you° as my
beloved children. 4:15 For* even if you° have ten-thousand guardians* in Christ, but not many fathers,
for* I fathered you° in Christ Jesus through the good-news, 4:16 therefore, I am encouraging you°:
become° imitators of me. 4:17 Because of this, I sent Timothy to you°, who is my beloved and faithful
child in the Lord, who will be reminding you° of my ways, the ones in Christ, just-as I am teaching
everywhere in every congregation*. 4:18 But as of me not coming to you°, some were being arrogant.
4:19

who have been arrogant, but the power. 4:20 For* the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.

arrogant, and did not rather mourn in-order-that he who did* this work might be taken away out-of
your° midst. 5:3 For* indeed, as being absent in the body, but being present* in the spirit, I have already
judged him thus (the one who worked out this thing), as though being present*, 5:4 in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, when you° and my spirit were gathered together, together-with the power of our
Lord Jesus, 5:5 to give such a one to the Adversary *for the utter-destruction of the flesh in-order-that

Cleanse° out the old leaven in-order-that you° may be a new batch, just-as you° are unleavened. For*
Christ our Passover was also sacrificed on our behalf. 5:8 So-then we should celebrate a festival, not
in old leaven, nor in the leaven of malice and wickedness, but in the unleavened bread of sincerity

or idolaters, otherwise, you° are consequently* obligated to go forth out-of the world. 5:11 But now,
I wrote to you° not to socialize yourselves together-with anyone if he is named a brother, who is
either a fornicator or greedy one, or an idolater or a reviler, or a drunkard or a ravening one, not to
even eat together-with such a person. 5:12 For* what is it to me to also judge the ones who are

of the unrighteous and not in front of the holy-ones? 6:2 Do you° not know that the holy-ones will be
judging the world? And if the world is judged among you°, are you° unworthy of the least of courts?
6:3
    Do you° not know that we will be judging the messengers? Consequently*, why not judge the
things of everyday life? 6:4 Therefore, if you° indeed have courts concerning things of everyday life,
why are you° seating these who have been scorned in the congregation* as judges? 6:5 I am saying this
to shame you°. So is there not one wise person among you°? Not even one who will be able to judge
between his brethren? 6:6 But brother is in a lawsuit with brother, and this in front of unbelieving
people! 6:7 Therefore, it is indeed already a literal loss to you°, that you° have lawsuits with
yourselves. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? 6:8 But instead you° are
wronging and are defrauding, and you° do these things to brethren.
    6:9

be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor pedophiles, nor homosexuals, 6:10 nor

foods, but God will be doing-away-with both this and these things. But the body is not for

is joined to a prostitute is one body? For* he says, The two will be one flesh. {Gen 2:24} 6:17 But he
who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. 6:18 Flee° fornication. Every sin, whatever a man practices, is
outside the body, but the one fornicating, sins at his own body. 6:19 Or do you° not know that your°
body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you°, whom you° have from God? And you° are not

     7:1
          Now concerning the things of which you° wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a
woman sexually. 7:2 But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife and let each woman
have her own husband. 7:3 Let the husband repay to the wife her owed benevolence and likewise also
the wife repay to the husband. 7:4 The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the
husband, and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife. 7:5
Do° not deprive one another, except it should be from agreement for a time, in-order-that you° may
occupy yourselves to fasting and to prayer, and you° may come to the same again, in-order-that the
Adversary may not tempt you° because of your° shortage of self-control. 7:6 But I am saying this
according-to concession, not according-to commandment. 7:7 For* I wish all men to be even as
myself. But each one has his own gift* from God, indeed one which is so and one which is thus.
     7:8
         But I am saying to the unmarried and to the widows, it is good for them if they remain even as
I am. 7:9 But if they do not exercise self-control, let° them marry, for* it is better to marry than to be
on fire. 7:10 But I command to the ones who have married (not I, but the Lord): the wife is not to be
separated from her husband, 7:11 (but even if she should be separated, let her remain unmarried, or
let her be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband is not to leave his wife.
     7:12
          But to the rest I say (not the Lord), if some brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents
to dwell with him, let him not leave her. 7:13 And if a wife who has an unbelieving husband, and he
consents to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 7:14 For* the unbelieving husband has been made
holy by the wife and the unbelieving wife has been made holy by the husband. Consequently*
otherwise, your° children are unclean, but now they are holy. 7:15 But if the unbelieving spouse
separates, let the one separate; the brother or the sister has not been enslaved in such things. Now
God has called us in peace. 7:16 For* what do you know, wife, if you will be saving your husband?
Or what do you know, husband, if you will be saving your wife?
     7:17
          Except, as God divided to each one, as the Lord has called each, so let him walk. And so I
myself am commanding in all the congregations*. 7:18 Was anyone called having been circumcised?
Let him not be uncircumcised. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
7:19
     Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments


262                                                                                           mlvbible.com
of God. 7:20 Let each one remain in this calling in which he was called. 7:21 Were you called being a
bondservant? Let it not be a care to you, but if you are also able to become free, use it rather. 7:22 For*
he who was called in the Lord, having been a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman; likewise also, the
free one who was called, is Christ’s bondservant. 7:23 You° were bought as one of value; do° not
become bondservants of men. 7:24 Brethren, let each one remain with God in this thing in which he
was called.
      7:25
            Now concerning virgins I have no commandment from the Lord, but I am giving my
viewpoint, as one who has been shown-mercy by the Lord to be faithful. 7:26 Therefore, I suppose this
to be* good, because of the present calamity, that it is good for a man to be thus. 7:27 Have you been
bound to a wife? Do not seek divorce. Have you been loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 7:28
But even if you should marry, you did not sin, and if the virgin should marry, she did not sin. But
such will have affliction in the flesh, and I would spare you°.
     7:29
           But I am saying this, brethren, the time is limited, furthermore it is that* both the ones who
have wives may be as though not having had one; 7:30 and the ones weeping, as though not weeping,
and the ones rejoicing, as though not rejoicing, and the ones buying, as though not having; 7:31 and
the ones who use this world, as though not making full use of it; for* the fashion of this world is
passing-away.
     7:32
           But I wish for you° to be carefree. He who is unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord,
how he will be pleasing the Lord; 7:33 but he who has married is anxious for the things of the world,
how he will be pleasing the wife. 7:34 He has been divided. And the unmarried woman (also the
virgin), is anxious for the things of the Lord, in-order-that she may be holy both in body and in spirit,
but she who is married is anxious for the things of the world, how she will be pleasing the husband.
7:35
     Now, I say this thing is advantageous for yourselves, not in-order-that I may cast a noose upon
you°, but a non-distraction for the decent, and devoted in the Lord.
     7:36
           But if anyone supposes he is behaving improperly over his virgin, if she is beyond her prime
and thus it ought to happen, let her do* what she wills; she is not sinning; let° them marry.
      7:37
            But he who stands, grounded in his heart, not having necessity, but has the authority
concerning his own will, and he has decided this in his own heart to keep his own virgin {Or: keep of
himself virgin}, he does* well. 7:38 So-then both he who betroths does* well, and he who does not betroth
is doing* better.
     7:39
          A wife has been bound by law inasmuch time as her husband is living, but if also the husband
should be fallen-asleep {i.e., dead}, she is free to be married to whom she wills, but only in the Lord.
7:40
     But she is fortunate if she remains so, according-to my viewpoint, and I think that I also have the
Spirit of God.

love* builds up. 8:2 But if anyone thinks to know anything, he has known nothing yet like it is
essential to know; 8:3 but if anyone loves* God, this one has been known by him. 8:4 Therefore,
concerning the food of idol-sacrifices, we know that an idol in the world is nothing and that there
is no other God except one. 8:5 For* if indeed* there are so called* gods, whether in heaven or upon
the earth (just-like there are many such gods and many such lords), 8:6 but to us, there is one God,

the Father, from whom are all things, and we are *for him, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through
whom are all things, and we are through him. 8:7 But the knowledge is not in all people, but until
now some, with the conscience of the idol, eat it like an idol-sacrifice, and their conscience is
defiled, being weak. 8:8 But food does not present us to God, for* neither if we eat, do we abound?
Nor, if we do not eat, are we lacking?
     8:9
          But beware°, lest this liberty of yours° might become a stumbling block to the weak. 8:10 For*
if anyone sees you (the one who has knowledge), reclining at a table in an idol’s sanctuary, will not
his conscience, being weak, be built up to eat what is the idol-sacrifices? 8:11 And the weak brother
(because of whom, Christ died) will be perishing upon the basis of your knowledge. 8:12 Now thus,
by sinning directly at the brethren and beating their weak conscience, you° are sinning directly at
Christ. 8:13 Hence, if food is offending my brother, I should never eat an idol’s meats forever, in-
order-that I should not offend my brother.

apostleship in the Lord.
     9:3
          My defense to the ones examining me is this: 9:4 have we no authority to eat and to drink? 9:5
Have we no authority to lead around a wife (a sister in the Lord), even as the rest of the apostles and
the brethren of the Lord and Cephas? 9:6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no authority not to
work? 9:7 Who would ever make war while supplying his own rations? Who plants a vineyard and
does not eat from its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not eat {i.e., drink} from the milk of
the flock? 9:8 I am not speaking these things according-to man. Or is the law not also saying these
things? 9:9 For* it has been written in the Law of Moses, ‘You will not muzzle a threshing bull.’ {Deu
25:4} God does not care only for the bulls, does he? 9:10 Or does he certainly say it because of us? For*
it was written because of us, that the one who is plowing ought to plow in hope, and the one who is
threshing ought to thresh in hope to partake of his hope.
     9:11
           If we sowed spiritual things to you°, is it a great thing if we will be reaping your° fleshly
things? 9:12 If others are partaking of this authority over you°, do we not more? But we did not use
this authority, but we are forbearing all things, in-order-that we should not give any hindrance to the
good-news of the Christ. 9:13 Do you° not know that the ones who work at the sacred things, eat the
things from the temple, and the ones who wait-upon the altar have their part together-with the altar?
9:14
     So, the Lord also commanded that the ones proclaiming the good-news, to live out-of the good-
news. 9:15 But I used nothing of these things, and I did not write these things in-order-that it may
become so with* me, for* it would be good for me rather to die, than in-order-that anyone should
make my boasting void. 9:16 For* if I proclaim the good-news, it is not boasting to me, for* necessity
is laying upon me; but woe is to me, if I, myself, do not proclaim the good-news. 9:17 For* if I am
doing* this voluntarily, I have a reward, but if I do so involuntarily, I have been entrusted with a
stewardship. 9:18 Therefore, what is the reward to me? In-order-that, in proclaiming the good-news
of the Christ without cost, I might place the good-news before you°, and *that* I should not make full
use of my authority in the good-news.
     9:19
          For* although {F} being free from all, I enslaved myself to all in-order-that I might gain all the

9:21
      I became like the lawless to the ones who are lawless (not being lawless to God, but lawful to
Christ) in-order-that I might gain the lawless. 9:22 I became to the weak ones like the weak in-order-
that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all people in-order-that I may certainly save
some. 9:23 But I am doing* this because of the good-news, in-order-that I might become a fellow

indeed ought not to have his head veiled, being* that he is the image and glory of God, but woman
is the glory of the man.
   11:8
         For* man is not from woman, but woman is from man; 11:9 for* also neither was the man created
because of the woman, but the woman because of the man. 11:10 The woman ought to have a sign of
authority upon the head because of this and because of the messengers. 11:11 However, neither is the
man separate from the woman, nor the woman separate from the man, in the Lord. 11:12 For* just-like
the woman is from the man, so the man is also through the woman, but all things are from God. 11:13
Judge° among you° yourselves. Is it suitable that a woman pray to God unveiled? 11:14 Or is not even
nature itself teaching you°, that, if a man indeed has long-hair, it is a dishonor to him? 11:15 But if a
woman has long-hair, it is a glory to her, because her hair has been given to her instead of a head
dressing. 11:16 But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the congregations*
of God.

          But in commanding this, I am not praising you°, because you° are not coming together *for the

best but *for the worst. 11:18 For* indeed, first of all, when you° are coming together in the
congregation*, I am hearing that splits are to exist in you°, and I believe some part of it. 11:19 For* it
is essential for sects to be also among you°, in-order-that the approved ones may become apparent
among you°.
     {The following section is Paul’s extreme sarcasm about their abuse of the Lord’s supper.}
     11:20
           Therefore, while you* are coming together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper,
11:21
      for* while* you° were eating, each one is taking his own supper before others, and indeed which
one is hungry and which one is drunken. 11:22 For* do you° not have houses *that* you° should eat and
drink in? Or do you° despise the congregation* of God and are shaming the ones who have nothing?
What should I say to you°? Should I praise you°? I should not praise you° in this.
     {Mar 14:22-25 & Mat 26:26-29 & Luk 22:19-20, 1Co 11:23-26.}
     11:23
           For* I received from the Lord what I also gave to you°, that the Lord Jesus in the night in
which he was being given up, took bread, 11:24 and having given-thanks, he broke it and said, Take°,
eat°: this is my body, which is being broken on your° behalf. Practice° this in my remembrance. 11:25
Likewise* also the cup, after they dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant* in my blood. Practice°
this in my remembrance whenever you° drink it. 11:26 For* whenever you° eat this bread and drink this
cup, you° are proclaiming the Lord’s death till which time he should come.
     11:27
           So-then whoever should eat this bread or should drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily of the
Lord, will be liable of the body and of the blood of the Lord. 11:28 But let a man test himself and so
let him eat from the bread and let him drink out-of the cup. 11:29 For* he who unworthily eats and
drinks, is eating and drinking condemnation to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.
     11:30
           Because of this, many among you° are weak and sick and a considerable number are fallen-
asleep {i.e., are dead}. 11:31 For* if we were discerning ourselves, we would not be judged. 11:32 But being
judged, we are disciplined by the Lord in-order-that we should not be condemned together-with the
world. 11:33 So-then my brethren, when you° come together *that* you should eat, wait° for one
another. 11:34 But if anyone is hungry, let him eat in his own house, in-order-that you° may not come
together *for condemnation. Now I will be commanding accordingly the rest as I may come.

     12:1
          Now brethren, I do not wish you° to be ignorant concerning spiritual gifts. 12:2 You° know that
when you° were Gentiles, you° were being led away to the voiceless idols, as you° would be led away
now. 12:3 Hence I make known to you°, that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is
accursed, and no one is able to say, Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.
     12:4
          Now there are diversities of gifts*, but the same Spirit. 12:5 And there are diversities of services
and the same Lord. 12:6 And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God, who is working
all things in all. 12:7 But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is advantageous:
12:8
     for* the word of wisdom is given to one through the Spirit, and the word of knowledge to another
according-to the same Spirit; 12:9 and miraculous faith to different one in the same Spirit; and gifts*
of healings to another in the same Spirit; 12:10 and workings of miracles to another; and prophecy to
another; and the discernings of spirits to another; varieties of languages to a different one; and the
translation of foreign languages to another; 12:11 but the one and the same Spirit is working all these
things, sectioning off to each one in his own way just-as he wills.

     12:12
           For* just-as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the one body,
being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. 12:13 For* also, we were all immersed* into one body,
in one Spirit, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondservants or free men, and all were made to drink
into one Spirit. 12:14 For* the body is also not one member, but many. 12:15 If the foot says, Because I
am not the hand, I am not from the body, contrary to this, is it not from the body? 12:16 And if the ear
says, Because I am not the eye, I am not from the body, contrary to this, is it not from the body? 12:17
If the whole body were an eye, where is the hearing? If the whole body were hearing, where is the
sense of smell? 12:18 But now God himself placed the members in the body, each one of them, just-as
he willed. 12:19 Now if all things were one member, where is the body? 12:20 But now they are indeed
many members, but one body. 12:21 Now the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you,
or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you°. 12:22 But much rather now, the members of the
body which seem to be* weaker are necessary; 12:23 and which parts of the body we think to be more
dishonored, we place even-more honor around these, and our indecent parts have even-more
decency; 12:24 but our decent parts have no need. But God mingled the body together, having given
even-more honor to the ones which are lacking, 12:25 in-order-that no splits should be in the body, but
in-order-that the members should have the same anxiety on behalf of one another. 12:26 And if one
member is suffering, all the members are suffering together-with it. If one member is glorified, all
the members are rejoicing together-with it. 12:27 Now you° are the body of Christ and members
individually. 12:28 And indeed God placed some in the congregation* of believers: first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, thereafter miracles, thereafter gifts* of healings, helps, those who
pilot others, those with varieties of languages. 12:29 All are not apostles, are they? All are not
prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All do not do miracles, do they? 12:30 All do not
have gifts* of healings, do they? All do not speak with foreign languages, do they? All do not
translate, do they? 12:31 But be° zealous for the better gifts*. And I will show to you° according-to still
a surpassingly-better way.

          If I speak with the languages of men, and even of messengers, but do not have love*, I have
become like noisy brass or a clanging cymbal. 13:2 And if I have the gift of prophecy and if I know all
mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so-then to remove mountains, but if I do not have
love*, I am nothing. 13:3 And if I should morsel out {i.e., give away little by little} all my possessions and
if I give my body in-order-that I would be burned, but if I do not have love*, I am profited nothing.
13:4
     Love* has patience. It is kind. Love* is not jealous. Love* does not brag. It is not arrogant. 13:5 It
does not behave improperly. It does not seek its own. It is not irritated. It is not reasoning evil. 13:6
It is not rejoicing in unrighteousness, but is rejoicing together-with the truth. 13:7 It is forbearing all
things, is believing all things, is hoping for all things, is enduring all things. 13:8 Love* never falls
short.
     But if there are prophecies, they will be done-away; if there are foreign languages, they will
cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done-away.
     13:9
           But we know partially and we prophesy partially; 13:10 but whenever the completed thing
comes, then what is partially will be done-away. 13:11 When I was an infant, I was speaking like an
infant, I had the mindset like that of an infant, I was reasoning like an infant. But when I became
a man, I have done-away-with the things of the infant. 13:12 For* now we see through a mirror, in an

enigma {i.e., dimly}, but then face to face. I know now partially, but then I will fully know just-as I
was also fully known.
     13:13
           But these three things are remaining now: faith, hope, love*, and the greater of these is love*.

     14:1
          Pursue° love*, but yet be° zealous for spiritual gifts, but rather in-order-that you° may prophesy.
14:2
      For* he who speaks in a foreign language does not speak to men, but to God; for* no one hears
with understanding, but he speaks mysteries in the spirit. 14:3 But he who prophesies speaks to men
for building up and encouragement and consolation. 14:4 He who speaks in a foreign language builds
himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the congregation*. 14:5 Now I wish for all of you° to speak
with foreign languages, but more in-order-that you° may prophesy, for* greater is he who prophesies
than he who speaks with foreign languages, unless one translates, in-order-that the congregation*
may receive building up.
     14:6
           But brethren, now if I come to you° speaking in foreign languages, what will I profit you°, if
I do not speak to you° either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching? 14:7 Even
the lifeless things when they give forth a voice, whether flute or harp, if it does not give a distinction
in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or harped? 14:8 For* if the trumpet also gives an
indistinct voice, who will prepare himself *for war? 14:9 So you° also, if you° do not give distinct
speech through the foreign language, how will it be known what is spoken? For* you° will be
speaking to air. 14:10 If it might be so: there are so-many varieties of foreign voices in the world and
yet none of them are unintelligible. 14:11 Therefore, if I do not know the power of the voice, I will be
a barbarian to the one who speaks with it, and he who speaks will be a barbarian with* me. 14:12 So
you° also, since you° are zealous ones of the spirits, seek° in-order-that you° may abound to the
building up of the congregation*. 14:13 Hence let he who speaks in a foreign language pray in-order-
that one may translate.
     14:14
           For* if I pray in a foreign language, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 14:15 Therefore,
what is it? I will pray with the spirit and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing-praise with the
spirit and I will also sing-praise with the mind. 14:16 Otherwise if you give-thanks with the spirit, how
will he who fills the place of the unskilled say the amen upon your thanksgiving, since he did not
know what you are saying? 14:17 For* you indeed give-thanks well, but the other is not built up. 14:18
I give-thanks to my God, I am speaking with foreign languages more than all of you°. 14:19 But in the
congregation*, I wish to speak five words through my mind in-order-that I might also instruct others,
than ten-thousand words in a foreign language.
     14:20
           Brethren, do° not become children in your mindsets (but be° infants in malice), but become°
mature in your mindsets. 14:21 It has been written in the law, ‘I will be speaking to this people in
different languages and by other lips, and thus they will not even hear me, says the Lord.’ {Isa 28:11-
12} 14:22 So-then foreign languages are *for a sign, not to the ones who believe, but to the unbelieving.
But prophecy is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to the believing. 14:23 Therefore, if the whole
congregation* should come together in the same place, and if all may be speaking with foreign
languages, and if unskilled or unbelieving people should enter, will they not be saying that you° are
insane? 14:24 But if all may prophesy and some unbelieving or unskilled person should enter, he is
reproved {Or: convicted} by all. He is judged by all. 14:25 And thus, the secret things of his heart become


mlvbible.org                                                                                              269
apparent, and so, having fallen down upon his face, he will be worshiping God, reporting that God
really is among you°.
     14:26
           Therefore, brethren, what is it? Whenever you° come together, each of you° has a psalm, has
a teaching, has a revelation, has a foreign language, has a translation. Let all things happen toward
your building up. 14:27 If anyone speaks in a foreign language, let it be according-to two or three at
the most and individually, and let one translate. 14:28 But if there is no translator, let him be silent in
the congregation*, and let him speak to himself and to God. 14:29 But let° the prophets speak by two
or three and let° the others discern. 14:30 But if a prophecy is revealed to another sitting by, let the first
be silent. 14:31 For* all of you° are able to prophesy according-to one {i.e., one at a time} in-order-that all
may learn and all might be encouraged. 14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the
prophets, 14:33 for* God is not a God of unrest, but of peace.
     As in all the congregations* of the holy-ones: 14:34 let° your° women {Or: wives} be silent in the
congregations*; for* it has not been permitted* for them to speak, but to be subject, just-as the law
also says. {Gen 3:16} 14:35 And if they wish to learn anything, let° them ask their own husbands in their
own house, for* it is shameful for women {Or: wives} to speak in a congregation*. 14:36 Or was it from
you° that the word of God went forth? Or did it only arrive *for you°?
     14:37
           If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him fully know what I write to you°,
that they are the commandments from the Lord. 14:38 But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
     14:39
            So-then brethren, be° zealous to prophesy and do° not forbid people to speak with foreign
languages. 14:40 Let all things happen decently and according-to some order.

     15:1
           Now I make known to you° brethren, the good-news which I proclaimed to you°, which you°
also received, in which you° are also standing, 15:2 through which you° are also saved, if you° are
holding-onto the good-news of the word in what I proclaimed to you°, unless you° vainly believed.
15:3
     For* I gave to you° first, what I also received: that Christ died on behalf of our sins according-to
the Scriptures; {Isa 53:8-9} 15:4 and that he was buried, and that he has been raised up on the third day
according-to the Scriptures. {Psa 16:10}
     {1Co 15:5-7, Mat 28:16-17, Mar 16:12-13, Luk 24:13-35, 24:44-49, Joh 20:26-31, Acts 1:3-8.}
     15:5
           And that he was seen by Cephas; thereafter by the twelve; 15:6 thereafter he was seen by over
five hundred brethren at once, out-of whom most remain until now, but some did also fall-asleep {i.e.,
died}; 15:7 thereafter he was seen by James; thereafter by all the apostles; 15:8 and last of all, like to the
premature-baby, he was seen also to me. 15:9 For* I am the least of the apostles, of whom I am not
sufficient to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the congregation* of believers of God. 15:10 But
I am what I am by the grace of God {Or: favor from God} and his grace toward me has not become
empty, but I labored even-more than all of them; but not I, but the grace of God which was together-
with me. 15:11 Therefore, whether it is I, or it is those men, so we preach and so you° believed.
     15:12
           Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised up from the dead, how are some among you°
saying that there is no resurrection of the dead? 15:13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not


270                                                                                               mlvbible.com
even Christ has been raised up; 15:14 and if Christ has not been raised up, consequently*, our preaching
is empty and your° faith is also empty. 15:15 Now, we are also found to be false* witnesses of God,
because we testified against God in saying that he raised the Christ up, whom consequently*, he did
not raise up, if indeed* the dead are not raised up. 15:16 For* if the dead are not raised up, not even
Christ has been raised up; 15:17 and if Christ has not been raised up, your° faith is futile: you° are still
in your° sins. 15:18 Consequently*, also the ones who fell-asleep in Christ perished. 15:19 If we are the
ones who have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are the most pitiful of all men.
    15:20
           But now Christ has been raised up from the dead, he became the first-fruit of the ones who
have fallen-asleep. 15:21 For* since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also came
through a man. 15:22 For* just-like all die in Adam, so all will also be given-life in Christ. 15:23 But each
in his own order: Christ the first-fruit; thereafter the ones who are the Christ’s in his presence. 15:24
Thereafter is the end, whenever he gives up the kingdom to the God and Father, whenever he does-
away-with all rule and all authority and power. 15:25 For* it is essential for him to reign, till which time
he would have placed all the enemies under his feet. {Psa 110:1} 15:26 The last enemy done-away-with
is death. 15:27 For* he subjected all things under his feet. {Psa 8:6} But whenever he says, All things
have been subjected, it is evident that is outside {i.e., except for} the one having subjected all things
to him. 15:28 But whenever all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected
to the one who subjected all things to him in-order-that God may be all in all.
    15:29
           Otherwise what will they do* who are immersed* on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not
literally raised up, why even are they immersed* on behalf of the dead? 15:30 Why are we also in peril
every hour? 15:31 I die every day by my boasting of you°, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord! 15:32
If I engaged-wild-beasts in Ephesus according-to the manner of man {this may have meant some kind of
gladiatorial contest}, what is the profit to me? If the dead are not raised up, ‘We should eat and drink,
for* the next-day we die.’ {Isa 22:13} 15:33 Do° not be misled: evil associations corrupt virtuous {F}
morals. {Or: customs or habits (inward & outward).} 15:34 Be° righteously sober and do° not sin, for* some
have ignorance of God. I say this to shame you°.
    15:35
           But someone will say, How are the dead raised up and with what manner of body do they
           15:36
come?            You fool, what you sow is not given-life if it does not die; 15:37 and what you sow, you do
not sow the body: the one will become, but a naked kernel, if it might be of wheat or anyone of the
rest of the grains; 15:38 but God gives it a body just-as he willed and to each of the seeds a body of its
own.
    15:39
           All flesh is not the same flesh, but indeed there is another flesh of men and another flesh of
animals and another of birds and another of fish 15:40 and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies (but the
glory of the heavenly is indeed different, and the glory of the earthly is different). 15:41 There is
another glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars; for* one star
carries more-value in glory than that of another star.
     15:42
            So also is the resurrection of the dead. If it is sown in corruption, it is raised up in
incorruption. 15:43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised up in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised
up in power. 15:44 It is sown a physical body; it is raised up a spiritual body. There is a physical body,
and there is also a spiritual body. 15:45 So also it has been written, ‘The first man Adam became a
living soul,’ {Gen 2:7} but the last Adam is giving-life *for our spirit. 15:46 But the spiritual was not
first, but the physical, and thereafter the spiritual. 15:47 The first man is out-of the earth, the terrestrial;


mlvbible.org                                                                                             271
the second man, the Lord, is out-of heaven. 15:48 Such-as is the terrestrial, such also are the terrestrial
and such-as is the heavenly, such also are the heavenly. 15:49 And just-as we have worn the image of
the terrestrial, we should also wear the image of the heavenly. 15:50 Now brethren, I say this, that flesh
and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, neither is corruption inheriting incorruption.
        {1Co 15:51-15:58 & Mat 24:27, 24:29-31 & Mar 13:24-37 & Luk 21:25-28 & Acts 1:11 & 1Th 4:13-17 & 2Th

     15:51
           Behold, I tell you° a mystery, Not all indeed will have fallen-asleep, but we will all be
changed, 15:52 in the briefest-moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet; for* the last trumpet
will sound and the dead will be raised up incorruptible and we will be changed. 15:53 For* it is
essential for this corruptible body to be clothed with incorruption and this mortal body to be clothed
with immortality. 15:54 But whenever this corruptible body should be clothed with incorruption and
whenever this mortal should be clothed with immortality, then the word, the one which has been
written, will become so, Death was swallowed up in victory. {Isa 25:8} 15:55 O death, where is your
sting? O Hades, where is your victory? 15:56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;
15:57
      but gratitude is to God, the one who is giving us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 15:58
So-then my beloved brethren, become° grounded, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the
Lord, knowing that your° labor is not empty in the Lord.

you° place beside himself, storing up what things, if he may be prospered in anything, in-order-that
whenever I come, no collections may happen then. 16:3 Now whenever I come*, I will be sending
these, whomever you° approve through letters, to carry your° favor away to Jerusalem; 16:4 and if it
is also worthy for me to travel there, they will be traveling together-with me. 16:5 But I will be coming
to you°, whenever I go through Macedonia, for* I am going through Macedonia. 16:6 Now having
obtained passage to you°, I will be remaining or even will be wintering with you°, in-order-that you°
may send me onward to wherever I may travel. 16:7 For* I do not wish to see you° now on the way,
but I am hoping to remain with you° some time, if the Lord permits*. 16:8 But I will be remaining in
Ephesus until the Pentecost, 16:9 for* a great and effective door has opened to me and many are laying
in opposition to me.
     16:10
           Now if Timothy comes, see° to it in-order-that he may become fearless toward you°; for* he
is working the work of the Lord, as I also am. 16:11 Therefore, do not let anyone scorn him. But send°
him onward in peace, in-order-that he should come to me, for* I am waiting for him with the
brethren. 16:12 Now concerning Apollos the brother, I encouraged him many times in-order-that he
should come to you° with the brethren and it was certainly not his will in-order-that he should come
now, but he will be coming whenever he should have an opportunity.

appointed themselves into the service *for the holy-ones. I encourage you° brethren, 16:16 in-order-that

these fulfilled the lack of yours°, 16:18 for* they gave-rest to my spirit and yours°. Therefore, recognize°
such people.

love* is with all of you° in Christ Jesus. Amen.


                                        {{ Introduction to 2 Corinthians 58-59 AD
   Paul continues his battle with those who think of themselves too highly and states he did not come to them right then
to spare them. He was giving them a chance to repent. About three chapters are spent showing his authority from Jesus,
and how good they had life in comparison to the apostles’ ‘verdict’ of death. In chapter 6 and 11, he talks about how bad
the people who had ministered to the Corinthians had it, but all of it was for the sake of the Corinthians and others. He
gave various encouragements: all in life is temporary; hope for a new body in heaven; in salvation, a new creation; you*
are in our hearts, etc. ‘You* are not distressed by us, but you* are distressed by your* own affections’ in 6:11 sums it
up for them.
   Then Paul describes a relief that many of the congregations had put together for the poor holy-ones (10:1) in
Jerusalem, one of many mentioned in the New Testament. Many were assigned and cooperated due to the high possibility
of robbers (food during a drought is more valuable than gold). Then in chapter 10, he redirects his letter to rebuke one
or many who claim that ‘they walk according to the flesh.’ He tells the Corinthians they should have already done it in
10:2. In 11, he talks to the Corinthians as he did to the Galatians about anyone adding in another good-news or teaching
not in the bible is a false teacher. Adding in ‘it doesn’t say not to’ is just as bad as excluding parts. Paul continues his
sarcasm in 12 and then his rebuke in 13 ‘not sparing’ them when he comes.}}

     1:1
         Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and Timothy our brother, to the
congregation* of God, she who is in Corinth, together-with all the holy-ones who are in the whole
of Achaia: 1:2 grace to you° and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
     1:3
         The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of the mercies and God of all
encouragement is gracious*; 1:4 who is encouraging us on our every affliction, *that* we may be able
to encourage the ones in every affliction, through the encouragement of which we ourselves are
encouraged by God. 1:5 Because just-as the sufferings of the Christ abound to us, so our
encouragement also abounds through the Christ. 1:6 But whether we are afflicted, it is on behalf of
your° encouragement and salvation; the one working in the endurance of the same sufferings which
we also are suffering; and our hope is steadfast on your° behalf. If whether we are encouraged, it is
on behalf of your° encouragement and salvation, 1:7 knowing that, just-like you° are partners of the
sufferings, so you° are also of the comfort. 1:8 For* brethren, we do not wish you° to be ignorant in
regard to our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were burdened down surpassingly,
beyond our power, so-then for us to be despaired even to be living. 1:9 But, we ourselves have had
the verdict of death in ourselves, in-order-that we should not be having confidence upon ourselves,
but upon God, the one raising up the dead; 1:10 who rescued us out-of so-great a death and is rescuing
us; in whom we have hoped that he will also still be rescuing us. 1:11 You° are also working together
on our behalf by your° supplication; in-order-that the gift* to us from many faces {i.e., mouths} might
be a giving-thanks through many people on your° behalf.
    1:12
         For* this is our boasting, the testimony of our conscience, that in clarity and sincerity of God,
not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we conducted ourselves in the world and even-more
toward you°. 1:13 For* we are writing no other things to you°, but what you° are reading or even what
you° know. Now I hope that you° will fully know these things we write until the end; 1:14 just-as you°
also recognized us partially, that we are your° boasting, just-as you° are also ours, in the day of our
Lord Jesus.
    1:15
         And in this confidence, I was planning to come to you° beforehand in-order-that you° may have

a second favor from me; 1:16 and through you° to go through into Macedonia, and away from
Macedonia to come to you° again and to be sent onward to Judea by you°. 1:17 Therefore, while
planning this thing, I did not then use fickleness, did I? Or what I plan, do I plan those things
according-to the flesh, in-order-that there should be from me the yes, yes and the no, no? 1:18 But
because God is faithful, our word toward you° did not become yes and no. 1:19 For* the Son of God,
Jesus Christ, who was preached among you° through us, that is, through me and Silvanus and
Timothy, did not become yes and no, but in him it has become yes. 1:20 For* as many things as are
the promises of God, in him is the yes and the amen is in him, for glory to God through us. 1:21 Now
he who is confirming us together-with you° in Christ and anointed us is God, 1:22 who also sealed us
and gave us the down-payment of the Spirit in our hearts.
    1:23
         Now I myself call upon God as a witness upon my soul, that I came into Corinth no more so
sparing you°. 1:24 Not that we have lordship over your° faith, but are fellow workers of your° joy; for*
you° are standing in the faith.

    2:1
        But I decided this thing for myself, not to come to you° again in sorrow. 2:2 For* if I make you°
sorrowful, who is it who also makes me joyous except he who is made sorrowful from me? 2:3 And
I wrote this same thing to you° in-order-that, if I came, I might not have sorrow from those of whom
it was essential for me to rejoice for; having confidence in all of you°, that my joy is the joy of all of
you°. 2:4 For* I wrote to you° out-of much affliction and dismay of heart through many tears; not in-
order-that you° should be made sorrowful, but in-order-that you° may know the love* which I have
even-more toward you°.
    2:5
        But if anyone has caused-sorrow, he has not caused-sorrow to me (that* I may not burden him),
but partially to you° all. 2:6 Sufficient to such a one is this penalty which was inflicted by the many;
2:7
    so-then you°, rather instead, are to forgive* and to encourage him, lest such a one might be
swallowed up with his sorrow even-more. 2:8 Hence, I encourage you° to validate your° love* toward
him. 2:9 For* I even wrote *for this reason; in-order-that I might know the trial of you°, if you° are
obedient* in all things. 2:10 But to whom you° forgive* anything, I forgive. For* if I have also forgiven*
(in whom I have forgiven* is because of you°), I have forgiven* in the face of Christ; 2:11 in-order-that
we should not be taken-advantage of by the Adversary. For* we are not ignorant of his devices.
    2:12
         Now after I came to Troas *for the good-news of the Christ and after a door had been opened
to me in the Lord, 2:13 I had not had relief in my spirit not able for me to find Titus my brother, but
having bid farewell to them, I went forth into Macedonia.
    2:14
         Now gratitude is to God, who always makes us to triumph in the Christ and the aroma of his
knowledge in every place is manifesting through us, 2:15 because we are a sweet-fragrance of Christ
to God. In the ones who are saved and in the ones who are perishing; 2:16 to which one is an aroma
from death to death, and to which one is an aroma from life to life. And who is sufficient in these
things? 2:17 For* we are not as the rest who are peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but
as from God, we speak in Christ in God’s sight.

    3:1
        Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? As if we have no need, as some people, letters
of commendation to you° or ones of commendation from you°? 3:2 You° are our letter, having been
inscribed in our hearts, being known and being read by all men; 3:3 being manifested that you° are a
letter of Christ, was served by us, not having been inscribed with ink, but with the Spirit of the living
God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets, in fleshly hearts. 3:4 Now we have such confidence through
Christ toward God; 3:5 not that we are sufficient from ourselves, to reason anything as out-of
ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God; 3:6 who also made us sufficient as servants of a new
covenant*; not from the writing, but from the Spirit; for* the writing kills, but the Spirit gives-life.
3:7
    But if the service of death, on scriptures having been engraved in stones, happened in glory, so-
then for the sons of Israel to not be able to stare at the face of Moses because of the glory of his
countenance, being done-away-with. 3:8 How will the service of the Spirit not rather be in glory? 3:9
For* if the service of condemnation had glory, how much rather is the service of righteousness
abounding in glory. 3:10 For* even what has also been glorified, has not been glorified in this respect,
because of the glory which surpasses it. 3:11 For* if what is being done-away is through glory, what
remains is much more in glory.
     3:12
          Therefore, having such a hope, we are using it in much boldness, 3:13 and are not just-as
Moses, who was placing a veil upon his face, *that* the sons of Israel might not stare at the end of
what was being done-away-with. {Exo 34:33} 3:14 But their minds were hardened; for* till today, the
same veil remains upon the public-reading of the old covenant*, not being unveiled, something which
is done-away in Christ. 3:15 But until this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil is laying upon their
heart. 3:16 But whenever it turns to the Lord, the veil is taken-away. 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit and
where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 3:18 But we all, with our face having been unveiled,
seeing the reflection of the glory of the Lord for ourselves, are being transfigured into the same
image from glory into glory, just-as from the Lord, the Spirit.

    4:1
        Because of this, having this service, just-as we were shown-mercy, we are not depressed. 4:2 But
we ourselves scoffed at the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the
word of God, but by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every conscience of
men in God’s sight. 4:3 But even if our good-news is being hidden, it is being hidden among the ones
perishing, 4:4 in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, *that* the
illumination of the good-news of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn
for them. 4:5 For* we are not preaching ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord and ourselves as your°
bondservants because of Jesus. 4:6 Because it is God, who said, ‘Light shine’ {Gen 1:3} out-of
darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in
the face of Jesus Christ.
    4:7
        But we have this treasure in baked-clay vessels, in-order-that the excellence of the power may
be from God and not from us. 4:8 We are being pressed in everything, but not distressed; being
perplexed, but not despairing; 4:9 being persecuted, but not forsaken; being cast down, but not being
destroyed; 4:10 always carrying around in the body the death of the Lord Jesus, in-order-that the life

of Jesus should also be manifested in our body. 4:11 For* we who live are habitually given up to death
because of Jesus, in-order-that the life of Jesus should also be manifested in our mortal flesh. 4:12 So-
then indeed, death is working in us, but life in you°. 4:13 But having the same spirit of the faith,
according-to what has been written, ‘I believed and hence I spoke.’ {Psa 116:10} We also believe and
hence we also speak; 4:14 knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus will also be raising us up
through Jesus and will be presenting us together-with you°. 4:15 For* all things are because of you°,
in-order-that the grace which increased through the many, the thanksgiving may abound to the glory
of God.
    4:16
         Hence we are not depressed, but even if our outward man is decayed, but yet the one inside
is renewed in this day and in the next day. 4:17 For* the momentary light weight of our affliction, is
working for us according-to excellence into greater excellence an everlasting weight of glory; 4:18
not to be noting the things being seen of us, but note the things which are not seen; for* the things
which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are everlasting. [2 Corinthians 5]
TOC 5:1 For* we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle should be torn-down, we have a
building from God, a house not made* with hands, everlasting in the heavens. 5:2 For* even we are
groaning in this house, longing to clothe ourselves with our house which is from heaven; 5:3 if
actually in also having clothed ourselves, we will not be found naked. 5:4 For* even we who are in
the tabernacle of our bodies are groaning, being burdened; not in which we wish to strip ourselves,
but we wish to clothe ourselves, in-order-that the mortal one may be swallowed up by life. 5:5 Now
God is the one who worked out this in us *for this same thing, who also gave the down-payment of
the Spirit to us. 5:6 Therefore, being always courageous, and knowing that while being at home in the
body, we are away from home, that is away from the Lord, 5:7 for* we are walking through faith, not
through sight. 5:8 But we are courageous and are delighted rather to be away from home, away from
the body and to be at home with the Lord. 5:9 Hence we also make it our aim to be well pleasing to
him, whether at home, or away from home. 5:10 For* it is essential for all of us to appear before the
judicial-seat of the Christ; in-order-that each one may get back the things done through {i.e., in} the
body, for what he practiced, whether good or evil.
    5:11
         Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we are persuading men, but we have been manifested
to God, and I hope to have also been manifested in your° consciences. 5:12 For* we are not again
commending ourselves to you°, but we are giving to you° a starting-point of boasting on our behalf,
in-order-that you° may have an answer toward the ones who boast in countenance {i.e., outward
appearance} and not in heart. 5:13 For* whether we were crazy, it was to God; or whether we are
sensible, it is for you°. 5:14 For* the love* of Christ is holding us together-with him, having judged this
thing that if one died on behalf of all, consequently*, all died; 5:15 and he died on behalf of all, in-
order-that the ones who are living should no longer live to themselves, but to the one who died and
was raised on their behalf. 5:16 So-then from hereafter we know no one according-to the flesh, but
even if we have known Christ according-to the flesh, but now we know him as such no more. 5:17 So-
then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things have passed-away; behold, all things
have become new. 5:18 But all things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ
and gave the service of reconciliation to us; 5:19 as that, God was reconciling the world to himself in
Christ not counting to them their trespasses and having placed the word of reconciliation in us. 5:20
Therefore, we are emissaries on behalf of Christ; as though God is encouraging you° through us. We

was made* the sin offering on our behalf; in-order-that we might become the righteousness of God
in him. [2 Corinthians 6] TOC 6:1 And working together-with him, we are also encouraging you° to
not accept the grace of God in vain; 6:2 (for* he says, ‘I heard you at an acceptable time and I helped
you in a day of salvation;’ {Isa 49:8} behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of
salvation), 6:3 giving no one a stumbling block in anything, in-order-that the service from us might
not be blamed. 6:4 But we are commending ourselves in everything, as servants of God: in much
endurance, in afflictions, in calamities, in distresses, 6:5 in lashes, in prisons, in unrests, in labors, in
sleeplessnesses, in fasts; 6:6 in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in
non-pretended love*, 6:7 in the word of truth, in the power of God; through the weapons of
righteousness from the right hand and from the left hand, 6:8 through glory and dishonor, through
defamation and good-repute; as misleaders and yet true*; 6:9 as being unrecognized and yet being fully
known; as dying and behold, we live; as being disciplined and yet not being slain; 6:10 as being
sorrowful, but habitually rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing and yet having
all things.

          O Corinthians, our mouth has opened to you°, our heart has been widened. 6:12 You° are not
distressed by us, but you° are distressed by your° own affections, 6:13 but the same as recompense (I

agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believing one with an unbelieving one? 6:16 And
what alliance has a temple of God with idols? For* you° are a temple of the living God; just-as God

being afflicted in everything; outside were quarrels, inside were fears. 7:6 But God, who encourages
the humble, encouraged us at the presence of Titus; 7:7 and not only at his presence, but also at the
encouragement to which he was encouraged in you°, while reporting to us your° longing, your°
anguish, your° zeal on my behalf; so-then for me to rejoice even more. 7:8 Because even if I made you°
sorrowful in the previous letter, I do not regret it; even if I was regretting it. For* I see that, that letter

but that you° were made sorrowful to repentance; for* you° were made sorrowful according-to the will
of God in-order-that you° might suffer-damage in nothing from us. 7:10 For* the sorrow which is
according-to the will of God is working unregretted repentance *for salvation, but the sorrow of the
world is working death. 7:11 For* behold how-much diligence this same thing (to be made sorrowful
according-to the will of God) worked in you°: but what a defense, but what indignation, but what
fear, but what longing, but what zeal, but what vengeance! You° commended yourselves in
everything to be pure in the matter. 7:12 Consequently*, if I also wrote to you°, it was not because of
the one who had done-wrong, nor because of the one who was wronged, but because of your°
diligent-aid on our behalf to be made manifest to you° in God’s sight. 7:13 Because of this, now, we
have been encouraged in your° encouragement; we rejoiced even-more rather upon the joy of Titus,
because his spirit has been given-rest from all of you°. 7:14 Because if I have boasted in anything on
your° behalf to him, I was not ashamed, but as we spoke all things to you° in truth, so also, our
boasting in Titus became truth. 7:15 And his affections are even-more toward you°, while
remembering the obedience of all of you°, how with fear and trembling you° accepted him. 7:16 I
rejoice that in everything I have courage in you°.

     8:1
          Now brethren, we are making known to you° the grace of God which has been given in the
congregations* of Macedonia; 8:2 because the abundance of the joy in much trial of affliction and
according-to the depth of their poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality. 8:3 I testify, because
according-to their power, and yet beyond their power, and their self-preference, 8:4 they were
beseeching from us, with much pleading, to help in the favor and the fellowship of the service of
relief to the holy-ones; 8:5 and, not only as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord
and to us through the will of God, 8:6 *that* we might encourage Titus, in-order-that just-as he made
a beginning, so he might also complete this favor in you°. 8:7 But just-like you° are abounding in
everything, in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all diligence and in the love* from you° to
us, see that* you° also may abound in this favor. 8:8 I do not speak according-to a commandment, but
through the diligence of others and testing the genuineness of your° love*. 8:9 For* you° know the favor

you° might be enriched through that poverty. 8:10 And I give my viewpoint in this; for* this is
advantageous for you°, who made a beginning from the past-year, not only to do* this, but also to will
it. 8:11 But now also, complete° the doing* of it; *that just-as there was the eagerness to wish it, so also
to complete it out-of what you° have. 8:12 For* if the eagerness lays before you°, according-to whatever
someone has, it is acceptable, not according-to what he does not have. 8:13 For* I do not say that* there
should be relief to others but affliction to you°, but from equality, your° abundance in the current time
is *for their lack, 8:14 in-order-that their abundance may also become *for your° lack, *that it may
become equality, 8:15 as it has been written, ‘He who gathered much did not increase, and he who
gathered few did not have less.’ {Exo 16:18}

assigned by the congregations* is our fellow traveling-associate together-with this favor, which is
served by us to the glory of the same Lord and to show our eagerness. 8:20 We are avoiding this thing,
lest anyone might blame us in the matter of this lavish donation which is served by us; 8:21 planning-
for good things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 8:22 Now we sent our
brother together-with them, whom we proved often, many times as being diligent in many things,
but now much more diligent, by the large confidence which he has in you°. 8:23 If anyone inquires in
regard to Titus, whether our brethren, the ambassadors* of the congregations* (the glory of Christ),
he is my partner and my fellow worker *for you°. 8:24 Therefore, show° yourselves to them in the face
of the congregations*, the example of your° love* and of our boasting on your° behalf.

        For* indeed, concerning the relief service *for the holy-ones, it is superfluous for me to write
to you°: 9:2 for* I know your° eagerness, of which I am boasting on your° behalf to the Macedonians,
that Achaia has been prepared from the past-year, and the zeal from you° stimulated most of them.
9:3
    But I sent the brethren in-order-that our boasting on your° behalf may not be made void in this
respect; in-order-that, just-as I was saying, you° may be prepared; 9:4 lest, if some Macedonians come
together-with me and might find you° unprepared, we (that* we should not say, you°) should be
ashamed in this firmness of boasting. 9:5 Therefore, I deemed it necessary to encourage the brethren
in-order-that they should go beforehand to you°, and should thus prearrange the proclaimed
beforehand bounty {Or: blessing; and following verses}. This is to be ready, as a bounty and not as
something from greed. 9:6 But I say this, He who is sowing sparingly will also be reaping sparingly,
and he who is sowing upon his bounties will also be reaping upon his bounties. 9:7 Let each man give
just-as he proposes in the heart; not out-of sorrow or out-of necessity {Or: from calamity}; for* God
loves* a joyful giver. 9:8 Now God is able to make abound all grace toward you°, in-order-that having
all self-sufficiency in everything, you° should always abound to every good work; 9:9 as it has been
written, ‘He scattered them, he gave to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.’{Psa 112:9} 9:10
Now he who is supplying seed to the sower and bread *for food, may supply and may multiply your°
seed and may cause the growth of the fruits* of your° righteousness. 9:11 You° are enriched in
everything to all liberality, which is working through us thanksgiving to God. 9:12 Because the service
of this ministry* not only is replenishing the things lacking of the holy-ones, but is also abounding
through many thanksgivings to God. 9:13 Through the trial of you° of this service, they are glorifying
God upon the subjection of your° confession toward the good-news of the Christ and at the liberality
of the generosity toward them and toward all; 9:14 and in their supplication on your° behalf, a longing-
for you° because of the surpassing grace of God upon you°. 9:15 But gratitude is to God upon his
indescribable gift.

For* the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but are mighty in God, toward the demolition of
strongholds, 10:5 demolishing evil reasonings and every exalted thing which is lifting itself up against
the knowledge of God and capturing every device of the Adversary to the obedience of the Christ;
10:6
      and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience*, whenever your° obedience might be fulfilled.
      10:7
            Are you° looking at things according-to their countenance? If anyone has confidence in
himself to be Christ’s, let him count this again from within himself, that, just-as he is Christ’s, so
are we also Christ’s. 10:8 For* even if I should boast even-more of something concerning our authority
(which the Lord gave to us *for your° building up and not *for your° demolition), I will not be
shamed; 10:9 in-order-that I may not seem as if I wished to make you° fearful through the letters from
me. 10:10 Because indeed he says, The letters are weighty and mighty, but the body’s presence is weak
and the speech has been nothing special. 10:11 Let such a one count this, that, such-as we are in word

standard* of which the God of measure divided to us which is able to reach up-to even you°. 10:14 For*
we do not overstretch ourselves, as though we are not reaching toward you°; for* till we have attained
even up to you° in the good-news of the Christ. 10:15 We were not boasting in the immeasurable things
(that is, in another’s labors), but having hope that when your° faith is grown to be magnified in you°
according-to our standard* into your° abundance, 10:16 reaching out to proclaim the good-news into
areas past you° and not to boast in the things prepared in another’s standard*. 10:17 But the one
boasting, let him boast in the Lord. 10:18 For* he who commends himself, that man is not approved
after being tested, but whom the Lord is commending.

husband, to present you° as a pure virgin to the Christ. 11:3 But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent
deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your° minds might be corrupted away from the clarity, the one in
the Christ. 11:4 For* if he who indeed comes, is preaching another Jesus, whom we have not preached,

freely the good-news of God to you°? 11:8 I plundered other congregations*, having taken

they may be found just-as we in what they are boasting. 11:13 For* such men are false* apostles,
workers of treachery, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ. 11:14 And it is not a marvelous
thing; for* even the Adversary fashions himself into a messenger of light. 11:15 Therefore, it is no great
thing if his servants are also fashioned like servants of righteousness, whose end will be according-to
their works.
     11:16
           I say again, not anyone should think me to be foolish; otherwise (even if as foolish), accept°
me in-order-that I may also boast in a little something. 11:17 What I speak in this firmness of boasting,
I do not speak according-to the Lord, but as in foolishness. 11:18 Since many are boasting according-to
the flesh, I will also be boasting. 11:19 For* you° are tolerating the foolish gladly, being so prudent. 11:20
For* you° tolerate it, if anyone is enslaving you°, if anyone is devouring you°, if anyone is taking from
you°, if anyone is lifting himself up, if anyone is whipping you° in the face. 11:21 I speak according-to
our dishonor, how that we were so weak. But in whatever anyone may be daring (I speak in
foolishness), I am also daring. 11:22 Are they Hebrews? I also. Are they Israelites? I also. Are they the
seed of Abraham? I also. 11:23 Are they servants of Christ? (I speak, as if having insanity) I am beyond
them: in labors even-more, in lashes surpassingly, in prisons even-more, in deaths often. 11:24 Five-
times, I received forty lashes beside {i.e., minus} one under the Jews. 11:25 I was lashed with rods three-
times. I was stoned once. I was shipwrecked three-times. I have spent a night and a day in the depth
of the sea; 11:26 often in journeys, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own race,
in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in
perils by false* brethren; 11:27 in labor and hardship, often in sleeplessnesses, in famine and thirst,
often in fasts, in cold and nakedness. 11:28 Plus the things which are outside, my every day pressure,
the anxiety of all the congregations*.

           Who is weak and I am not weak? Who is offended and I am not on fire? 11:30 If it is essential
for me to boast, I will be boasting in the things which are from my weakness. 11:31 The God and
Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is gracious* forever, knows that I am not lying. 11:32 In
Damascus the Ethnarch of Aretas, the king, was guarding the Damascenes’ city, wishing to arrest

     I know a man in Christ, who fourteen years before (whether in the body, I do not know or outside

excellence of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of the Adversary, in-

of Christ; for* whenever I may be weak, then I am mighty.

signs of an apostle were worked among you° in all endurance, in signs and wonders and miracles.
12:13
      For* what is it in which you° were lesser, beyond the rest of the congregations*, except in that I
myself did not encumber you°? Forgive*° me this unrighteousness!

            Behold, I hold ready to come to you° the third-time, and I will not be encumbering you°; for*
I am not seeking the things of you°, but you°; for* the children ought not to store up for the parents,
but the parents for the children. 12:15 Now I will gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your°
souls; even if, when loving* you° even-more, means I am loved* even-less. 12:16 But let it be so,
nevertheless, I did not burden you°. But, being* a crafty person, I took you° with treachery. 12:17
Anyone of whom I have sent to you°, I did not take-advantage of you° through him, did I? 12:18 I

mourning for many of the ones who have sinned before and did not repent upon the uncleanness and

                                           {{ Introduction to Galatians 55-58 AD
    The letter is addressed to Christians as is all ‘letters’ and this time multiple congregations all located in Galatia. Paul
wastes no time getting right to the point that there is only ‘one good-news of Jesus’ and obeying any other is a curse.
Apparently, some previously converted Jew(s) were teaching the previously converted Gentile Christians that they had
to be circumcised and keep the Old Covenant Laws. A wonderful comparison of the ‘promise to’ and the ‘faith of
Abraham’ and ‘the faith of Christ’ seen here in Galatians. The real purpose of God was always to bring Christ into the
world. However, Paul with various arguments pretty much put it in the context in 5:1-6. Circumcision is not profitable,
but if you keep any of the Law (Old Testament), then you have to practice all of it. However, in Christ, all are free from
the Old Testament Law and Christians are not a slave to it. Then the typical ‘slap on the face’ from Paul ‘you* who are
made righteous by the law; you* have fallen from the grace of God.’
    Therefore, if you are keeping tithing, then you have to keep the Sabbath (Saturday) and about 630 more laws. Then
once again ‘who hindered you* not to obey the truth’‘ I wish-that those who are unsettling you* will even castrate
themselves. No doubt, we know Paul’s (God’s) opinion of false teachers who lead Christians away from the truth by
making them keep Old Testament Law. For* all the Law is fulfilled in one word, in this: ‘You will love* your neighbor
like yourself’ 5:14.}}

         Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the
Father, who raised him up from the dead), 1:2 and all the brethren who are together-with me, to the
congregations* of Galatia: 1:3 grace to you° and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
1:4
    who gave himself concerning our sins, *that he might liberate us out-of the present evil age,
according-to the will of our God and Father, 1:5 in which is the glory, forevermore. Amen.
    1:6
         I marvel that you° are so quickly transferring yourselves from the one who called you° by the
favor of Christ to a different good-news; 1:7 which is not another good-news, except now there are
some who are disturbing you° and wish to pervert the good-news of the Christ. 1:8 But even if we or
a messenger from heaven, should proclaim to you° any good-news contrary to what we ourselves
proclaimed to you°, let him be accursed. 1:9 As we have said before, and so now I am saying again,
if anyone proclaims to you° any good-news contrary to what you° received, let him be accursed. 1:10
For* am I now persuading men or God? Or am I seeking to please men? For* if I was still pleasing
men, I myself would not be a bondservant of Christ.
    1:11
          But I am making known to you°, brethren, the good-news which was proclaimed by me, that
it is not according-to man. 1:12 For* I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received
it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 1:13 For* you° have heard previously of my conduct in Judaism,
how that I was surpassingly persecuting the congregation* of believers of God and was making havoc
of her; 1:14 and how I was progressing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own race,
possessing even-more zealousness of the ancestral traditions. 1:15 But when God was delighted, he
separated* me from my mother’s womb, and having called me through his grace, 1:16 to reveal his Son
in me, in-order-that I may proclaim the good-news of him among the nations. Immediately, I did not
consult with flesh and blood, 1:17 nor did I go up into Jerusalem to the ones who were apostles before
me, but I went away into Arabia, and I returned again into Damascus.
     1:18
          Thereafter, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter and
remained with him fifteen days. {Fall 39 AD.} 1:19 But I did not see any other of the apostles, except
James the Lord’s brother. 1:20 Now what I am writing to you°, behold, in God’s sight that I am not

lying. 1:21 Thereafter I came to the districts of Syria and Cilicia. 1:22 But I was still unrecognized by
face to the congregations* of Judea, which are in Christ; 1:23 but they were only hearing that, The one
previously persecuting us is now proclaiming the good-news of the faith of which he was previously
making havoc. 1:24 And they were glorifying God with* me.

    2:1
        Thereafter, I went-up again to Jerusalem after fourteen years with Barnabas, also having taken
Titus together-with me. {Acts 15} 2:2 But I went-up according-to revelation, and I myself submitted
to them the good-news which I am preaching among the Gentiles (but privately before the ones of
repute), lest I might be running or had run in vain.
    2:3
        But not even Titus who was together-with me, being a Greek, was urged to be circumcised. 2:4
But it was because of smuggled in false* brethren, those who entered in beside us to spy out our
freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, and in-order-that they might enslave us, 2:5 to whom, even
for an hour, we did not yield to their subjection, in-order-that the truth of the good-news might
remain with you°.
    2:6
        Now they did not contribute anything to me, that is from the ones of repute and from the ones
reputed to be something (for* what sort of person they were previously, carries nothing of more-
value-than that to me {i.e., utter sarcasm}; God does not receive the countenance of man). 2:7 But
instead, after they saw that I had been entrusted with the good-news of the uncircumcision, just-as
Peter that of the circumcision 2:8 (for* he who worked in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision
also worked in me to the Gentiles). 2:9 And having known the grace which was given to me, James
and Cephas and John (the ones reputed to be pillars), gave the right hand of fellowship to me and
Barnabas, that* indeed we should go to the Gentiles but they should go to the circumcision, 2:10
adding only that* we should remember the poor, which I was diligent also to do* this same thing.
     2:11
           But when Peter came to Antioch, I stood against him to his face, because he was being
condemned. 2:12 For* he was eating together with the ones from the Gentiles before some came from
James. But when they came, he was retreating back and separating* himself, fearing the ones who
are from the circumcision. 2:13 And the rest of the Jews were also hypocrites together-with him, so-
then even Barnabas was led away with their hypocrisy. 2:14 But when I saw that they are not being
straightforward pertaining to the truth of the good-news, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being*
a Jew, are living like-a-Gentile and not like-a-Jew, why are you urging the Gentiles to live like-a-
Jew?
    2:15
          We are Jews by nature and not sinners from the Gentiles, 2:16 knowing that a man is not made
righteous from the works of the law, if it is not through the faith of Jesus Christ. Also we believed
in Christ Jesus, in-order-that we might be made righteous from the faith of Christ and not from the
works of the law, because not any flesh will be made righteous from the works of the law.
    2:17
          But if seeking to be made righteous in Christ, we ourselves were also found to be sinners, is
then Christ a servant of sin? Let it not happen! 2:18 For* if I build up again these things which I have
torn-down, I establish myself as a transgressor. 2:19 For* through the law I died to the law in-order-
that I might live to God.
    2:20
          I have been crucified together-with Christ. I am now no longer living, but Christ is living in
me and that life which I am now living in the flesh, I am living in faith, in the faith of the Son of

God, who loved* me and gave himself up on my behalf. 2:21 I am not nullifying the grace of God; for*
if righteousness is through the law, consequently*, Christ died undeservedly.
                                            [Galatians 3] TOC
    3:1
        O foolish Galatians, who bewitched you° that the truth is not to be obeyed (in which your eyes,
Jesus Christ was portrayed among you° as having been crucified)? 3:2 I only wish to learn this thing
from you°. Did you° receive the Spirit from the works of the law or from the report of faith? 3:3 Are
you° so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you° now being completed in the flesh? 3:4 You°
suffered vainly so-many things? If actually it was even vainly. 3:5 Therefore, is the one supplying the
Spirit to you°, and working miracles among you°, are they from the works of the law or from the
report of faith?
    3:6
         Just-as Abraham believed God and it was counted to him *for righteousness. {Gen 15:6?} 3:7
Consequently*, you° know that the ones who are from faith, these are sons of Abraham. 3:8 Now the
Scripture having foreseen that God would make the Gentiles righteous from faith, proclaimed the
good-news beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘All the nations will be blessed in you.’ {Gen 12:3, 18:18,
22:18, 26:4, 28:14} 3:9 So-then the ones who are sons from faith are blessed together-with the believing
Abraham. 3:10 For* as many as are from the works of the law are under a curse; for* it has been
written, ‘Cursed is everyone who is not remaining in all things which have been written in the book
of the law, to practice them.’ {Deu 27:26} 3:11 Now it is evident that no one is made righteous in the
law before God, because, ‘The righteous will be living from faith.’{Hab. 2:4} 3:12 Now the law is not
from faith, but, ‘The man who has practiced them will be living in them.’{Lev 18:5} 3:13 Christ bought
us up out-of the curse of the law, after he became a curse on our behalf; for* it has been written,
‘Cursed is everyone who hangs upon a tree,’ {Deu 21:23} 3:14 in-order-that the blessing of Abraham
might happen to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, in-order-that we might receive the promise of the Spirit
through the faith.
    3:15
         Brethren, I am speaking according-to the manner of man: even a man’s covenant* after it has
been validated, no one nullifies or alters it with provisions. 3:16 Now the promises were spoken to
Abraham and to his seed. He does not say and to seeds, as upon many, but as upon one and ‘to your
seed,’ who is the Christ. {Gen 22:18, 26:4} 3:17 Now I am saying this: the law, having happened four
hundred and thirty years afterward, is not invalidating the covenant* which has been validated
beforehand by God in reference to Christ, *that* it should do-away-with the promise. {Exo 12:40} 3:18
For* if the inheritance is from the law, it is no more from the promise, but God has granted it to
Abraham through the promise. 3:19 Therefore, why was the law? It was added because of
transgressions, till the seed should come to whom it has been promised, having been appointed
through messengers by the hand of an intermediary. 3:20 Now the intermediary is not of just one, but
God is one. 3:21 Therefore, is the law against the promises of God? Let it not happen! For* if a law
was given (the one being able to give-life), righteousness really would have been from the law. 3:22
But scripture locked up all things together under sin in-order-that the promise which comes from
the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the ones who believe.
    3:23
          But before the faith came, we were being guarded under the law, having been locked up
together to the faith, the one which is about to be revealed. 3:24 So-then the law has become our

guardian* to bring us to Christ, in-order-that we might be made righteous from the faith. 3:25 But after
the faith came, we are no longer under a guardian*. 3:26 For* you° are all sons of God, through the
faith, in Christ Jesus. 3:27 For* as many as were immersed* into Christ, you° have clothed yourselves
with Christ. 3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither bondservant nor free man; there is
no male and female; for* you° all are one in Christ Jesus. 3:29 But if you° are consequently* Christ’s,
you° are also Abraham’s seed and heirs according-to the promise.

    4:1
         But I am saying inasmuch time as the heir is an infant {Or: a minor. Same in 4:3}, he carries
nothing of more-value-than that of a bondservant, though being lord of all, 4:2 but is under
commissioners and stewards till the appointed-day of the father. 4:3 So also, when we were infants,
having been enslaved under the elemental principles of the world, 4:4 but when the fullness of the
time came, God sent out his Son, born out-of a woman, born under the law, 4:5 in-order-that he might
buy the ones up who were under the law in-order-that we might receive the sonship. 4:6 And because
you° are sons, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your° hearts, crying, Abba, Father. 4:7 So-then
you are no longer a bondservant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.
   4:8
        But indeed back then, not knowing God, you° were enslaved to the ones who by nature are not
gods. 4:9 But now having known God, but rather having been known by God, how are you° returning
again over to the weak and poor elemental principles, in which things you° again wish to be enslaved
anew? 4:10 You° yourselves observe days and months and seasons and years. 4:11 I fear for you°, lest
somehow I have vainly labored to you°.
   4:12
         Brethren, I beseech of you°, become like I am, because I have also become like you° are. You°
wronged me in nothing; 4:13 but you° know that I myself proclaimed the good-news to you°
beforehand because of a weakness of the flesh. 4:14 And you° did not scorn, nor did you° spurn my
test, the one in my flesh, but you° accepted me as a messenger of God, even as Christ Jesus. 4:15
Therefore, what was your° good-fortune? For* I testify of you°, that, if possible, you° would have
given your° eyes to me, having shoveled {i.e., popped} them out. 4:16 So-then have I become your°
enemy, declaring the truth to you°? 4:17 They are zealous for you° in no good way. But they wish to
lock you° out from us in-order-that you° may be zealous for them. 4:18 But it is always good to be
zealous in a good thing and not only while* I was present* with you°. 4:19 My little-children, of whom
I am travailing again till which time Christ should be formed in you° again. 4:20 But I was wishing to
be present* with you° now, and to change my voice, because I am perplexed at you°.
    4:21
         Tell° me, the ones wishing to be under the law, are you° not hearing the law? 4:22 For* it has
been written, that Abraham had two sons, one from the maidservant and one from the free woman.
{Gen 21:2-9} 4:23 But indeed the one from the maidservant has been born according-to the flesh, but
the one from the free woman has been born through the promise. 4:24 Which things are allegorized,
for* these women are two covenants*, indeed one from Mount Sinai, who is Hagar, giving-birth to
children into bondage. 4:25 For* the Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the Jerusalem
which is now and she is enslaved with her children. 4:26 But the Jerusalem which is above is free,
which is the mother of all of us. 4:27 For* it has been written, ‘Barren one who is not bearing children,


290                                                                                               mlvbible.com
be joyous; burst forth and cry, the one who is not travailing, because many more are the children of
the desolate rather than the one who has the husband.’ {Isa 54:1} 4:28 Now brethren, we are children
of the promise according-to Isaac. 4:29 But just-like then, he who was born according-to the flesh was
persecuting the one who was born according-to the Spirit, so it is also now. 4:30 But what does the
Scripture say? Cast forth the maidservant and her son, for* the son of the maidservant should never
inherit with the son of the free woman. {Gen 21:10} 4:31 Consequently*, brethren, we are not children
of a maidservant, but of the free woman.

         Therefore, stand-firm° in the freedom in which Christ made us free, and do° not be held again
in a yoke of bondage.
     5:2
         Behold, I, Paul say to you°, that if you° are circumcised, Christ will be profiting you° nothing.
5:3
     Now, I am testifying again to every man being circumcised, that he is a debtor to practice the
whole law. 5:4 You° were done-away-with, cut off from the Christ, you° who are made righteous by
the law; you° fell from the grace of God. 5:5 For* we are waiting for the hope of righteousness in a
Spirit from faith. 5:6 For* neither circumcision nor uncircumcision prevails over anything in Christ
Jesus, but faith working through love*.
    5:7
         You° were running well; who hindered you°, saying, The truth is not to be obeyed? 5:8 The
persuasion like this is not from the one who is calling you°. 5:9 A little leaven leavens the whole batch.
5:10
     I have confidence in you° in the Lord, that you° will not be mindful of another person and he who
is disturbing you° will be bearing the judgment, whoever he may be. 5:11 But I, brethren, if I still
preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Consequently*, has the offense of the cross been
done-away-with? 5:12 I wish-that the ones who are unsettling you° will even castrate themselves.
     5:13
           For* brethren, you° were called upon the basis of freedom; only do not use the freedom *for
a starting-point for the flesh, but serve*° one another through love*. 5:14 For* all the law is fulfilled in
one word, in the command: ‘You will love* your neighbor like yourself.’ {Lev 19:18} 5:15 But if you°
are biting and devouring one another, beware°, that you° might not be consumed by one another.
     5:16
           But I am saying, walk° by the Spirit and you° should never complete the lust of the flesh. 5:17
For* the flesh lusts against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh, and these lay in opposition to
one another, in-order-that you° may not do* these things which you° would wish. 5:18 But if you° are
led by the Spirit, you° are not under the law.
      5:19
            Now the works of the flesh are apparent, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
unbridled-lust, 5:20 idolatry, sorcery, hostilities, strifes, jealousies, furies, selfish ambitions,
dissensions, sects, 5:21 envies, murders, drunkennesses, revelings and things similar to these things;
which I am saying to you° beforehand, also just-as I foretold to you°, that the ones practicing such
things, they will not be inheriting the kingdom of God!
     5:22
          But the fruit of the Spirit is love*, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, 5:23 meekness
and self-control. There is no law against such. 5:24 But the ones who are of the Christ crucified the
flesh together-with its passions and lusts.
     5:25
           If we are living in the Spirit, we should also march in the Spirit. 5:26 Do° not become conceited,

    6:1
        Brethren, even if a man should be overtaken in any trespass, you°, the spiritual, mend° such a
one in a spirit of meekness, noting any trespass in yourself, lest you might also be tempted. 6:2 Bear°
the burdens of one another and thus fulfill° the law of the Christ. 6:3 For* if anyone thinks himself to
be something, being nothing, he is deceiving himself. 6:4 But let each one test his own work and then
he will have the boasting toward himself alone and not toward the other. 6:5 For* each one will be
bearing his own load.
    6:6
         But let him, the one being instructed in the word, share in all good things with the one who
instructs. 6:7 Do° not be misled. God is not ridiculed; for* whatever a man should sow, he will also
be reaping this thing. 6:8 Because he who is sowing to his own flesh will be reaping corruption from
his flesh, but he who is sowing to the Spirit will be reaping everlasting life from the Spirit. 6:9 Now
we should not be depressed in practicing good, for* we will be reaping in our own time, if being not
faint. 6:10 Therefore, consequently*, as we have opportunity, we should work what is the good thing
toward everyone but especially in the household of the faith.
    6:11
         Behold°, how-large the alphabet letters are I wrote to you° with my own hand.
    6:12
          As many as wish to have a good* countenance in the flesh, these are urging you° to be
circumcised only in-order-that they may not be persecuted for the cross of the Christ. 6:13 For* they
themselves do not even observe the law (the ones who have been circumcised), but they wish you°
to be circumcised in-order-that they may boast in your° flesh. 6:14 But let it not happen for me to
boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to
me and I to the world. 6:15 For* neither anything, circumcision nor uncircumcision, prevails in Christ
Jesus, but a new creation. 6:16 And as many as will be marching by this standard*, peace and mercy
is upon them and upon the Israel of God.
    6:17
         Furthermore let no one be harassing me, for* I bear the brands of the Lord Jesus on my body.
    6:18
         The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your° spirit, brethren. Amen.

                                          {{ Introduction to Ephesians 62-64 AD
    By the time, Paul wrote to the Ephesian congregation, they seem to have few problems, which were so common to
the other congregations of the Lord in his letters, or they had already learned the truth from them. Paul is still in prison
and sends others in his place to help and encourage them. The introduction in the first chapter and second about God’s
favor; his original plan for our salvation, all we have to do it obey it. Eph. contains the most misquoted verse in the Bible
by Christians, completely out-of context, 2:8. God made a plan for us to be saved from our sins and showed us many
examples in Acts. Once saved from your past sins, Christians have the letters to guide them on how to stay in God’s grace
and receive further forgiveness of sin for us as the ‘new creation.’ So many miss this fact. In chapter 3, he describes
God’s plan, a mystery hidden until this age when the Gentile and the Jew would be together in one body, the congregation
of believers. The absolute best description of what the body of Christ is supposed to be and follow in Chapter 4:1-6, 11-
16. We pray that all ‘achieve to the unity of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son.’ In Chapter 5, Paul uses an
example of a husband and wife to describe Jesus’ love for the congregation. In Chapter 6, Paul tells us the devil is the
real enemy, and only the knowledge of God’s word can defeat him and his schemes.}}

         Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, to the holy-ones who are in Ephesus
and the faithful in Christ Jesus: 1:2 grace to you° and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
     1:3
         The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is gracious*, who blessed us in every spiritual
blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 1:4 just-as he chose us in him before the conception of the
world, for us to be holy and unblemished in his sight in love*. 1:5 God beforehand determined us
toward the sonship through Jesus Christ to himself, according-to the delight of his will, 1:6 to the
praise of the glory of his favor {‘favor’ and ‘grace’ are from the same Greek word in the MLV}, in which he
favored us in the beloved, 1:7 in whom we have the redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
of the trespasses of us according-to the riches of his grace. 1:8 It is this grace which abounded toward
us in all wisdom and prudence. 1:9 And God made known to us the mystery of his will, according-to
his delight which he purposed in him, 1:10 to a stewardship of the fullness of the times, to sum up all
things in the Christ, the things upon the heavens and the things upon the earth. 1:11 It was in him, in
whom also we were made an inheritance, having been determined beforehand according-to the
purpose of the one who is working all things according-to the plan of his will. 1:12 This was so *that*
we should be to the praise of his glory, even us, the ones who have hoped before in the Christ, 1:13
in whom you° also, having heard the word of the truth, the good-news of your° salvation, in whom,
having also believed, you° were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 1:14 who is a down-payment
of our inheritance, to the redemption of the ownership of God to the praise of his glory.
     1:15
          Because of this, I, also having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you° and the
love* which you° have toward all the holy-ones, 1:16 am not ceasing giving-thanks on your° behalf,
making* a remembrance of you° in my prayers, 1:17 in-order-that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of glory, may give to you° a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him.

      The eyes of your° heart have been enlightened, *that* you° may know what is the hope of his
calling and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance among the holy-ones, 1:19 and what is

seated him by his right hand in the heavenly places, 1:21 up above all rule and authority and power
and lordship and every name that is being named, not only in this age, but also in the future age. 1:22

all conducted ourselves previously in the lusts of our flesh, practicing the wills of the flesh and of
the perceptions and we were children of wrath by nature, even as the rest. 2:4 But God, being rich in
mercy, because of his much love* with which he loved* us, 2:5 even us being dead in our trespasses,

Christ Jesus. 2:8 For* you° are saved by the grace through the faith, and this thing, the gift of God, is
not from you°, 2:9 not from works, in-order-that not anyone should boast. 2:10 For* we are his product,

from the covenants* of the promise, having no hope and were godless in the world. 2:13 But now in
Christ Jesus you° who are previously from afar became near to him in the blood of the Christ. 2:14 For*
he himself is our peace, who made* us both one and having torn-down the middle wall of the fence,

     having done-away-with the hostility in his flesh, which is the Law of commandments in decrees;
in-order-that he might create in himself the two into one new man, thus making* peace, 2:16 and might
reconcile the two both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility in himself.

     And after he came, he proclaimed the good-news of peace to you° the ones who were from afar
and peace to the ones who were near, 2:18 because through him we both have the access in one Spirit
to the Father. 2:19 Therefore, consequently*, you° are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you° are
fellow citizens of the holy-ones and members of the household of God, 2:20 having been built upon
the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ himself being the cornerstone, 2:21 in
whom all the building, fitly framed together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord; 2:22 in whom
you° are also built together into a residence of God in the Spirit.

a joint body and joint partakers of his promise in the Christ through the good-news, 3:7 of which I
became a servant, according-to the gift of the grace of God which was given me according-to the
working of his power. 3:8 This grace was given to me, the least of all the holy-ones, to proclaim the
good-news of the untraceable riches of Christ among the Gentiles; 3:9 and to enlighten all with what
the stewardship of the mystery is, of which has been hidden from the ages, in God who created all
things through Jesus Christ, 3:10 in-order-that now the multifaceted wisdom of God might be made
known to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly places through the congregation* of
believers. 3:11 This was according-to the purpose of the ages, which he made* in Christ Jesus our
Lord, 3:12 in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through his faith. 3:13 Hence I am
asking you° not to be depressed at my afflictions on your° behalf, which are your° glory.

         Therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, am encouraging you° to walk worthily of the calling of
which you° were called, 4:2 with all humility and meekness, with patience tolerating one another in
love*, 4:3 being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4:4 There is one body and
one Spirit, just-as you° were also called in one hope of your° calling; 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one
immersion*, 4:6 one God and Father of all, the one over all and through all and in us all.

    Hence he says, ‘After he ascended to high, he captured captivity and gave presents to men.’ {Psa

downward parts of the earth first? 4:10 He who descended is also the same as he who ascended above
all the heavens in-order-that he might fill all things.

the building up of the body of the Christ, 4:13 till we all might achieve into the unity of the faith and
of the full knowledge of the Son of God, into a mature man, into the measure of the stature of the
fullness of the Christ, 4:14 in-order-that we may no longer be infants, bobbing on the waves and being

head, the Christ, 4:16 from whom all the body (being fitly framed and knitted together through every
supplying joint, according-to the working in measure of each one part) and who is making* the
growth of the body to the building up of itself in love*.
     4:17
          Therefore, I am saying and testifying this in the Lord: you° are to walk no longer as the rest
of the Gentiles who are also walking around in the futility of their mind, 4:18 having been darkened
in their mind, being alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them,
because of the hardening of their heart, 4:19 who are apathetic, gave themselves up to unbridled-lust,
*
  for the working of all uncleanness in greed.
     4:20
          But you° did not so learn the Christ, 4:21 if you° actually heard him and were taught by him, as
the truth is in Jesus: 4:22 to place away from you° the old man, according-to your° former conduct, the
one who is corrupted according-to the lusts of deception, 4:23 and to be young again in the spirit of
your° mind, 4:24 and to have clothed yourselves with the new man, who was created according-to God,
in righteousness and holiness of the truth.
     4:25
          Hence, placing all the lying away from yourselves, speak° each one the truth with his neighbor,
because we are members of one another. 4:26 ‘Be° angry and do° not sin.’ {Psa 4:4} Do not let the sun
set upon your° anger, 4:27 nor give° a chance to the devil. 4:28 Let the one who steals, steal no longer,
but rather let him labor, working at what is the good thing with the hands he has in-order-that he may
have something to give to the one who has need. 4:29 Do not let any rotten speech travel from your°
mouth. But if something is good for the building up of a need, say it in-order-that it may give a favor
to the ones hearing. 4:30 And do° not make the Holy Spirit of God sorrowful, in whom you° were
sealed to the day of redemption. 4:31 Let all bitterness and fury and anger and outcrying and
blasphemy, together-with all malice, be taken away from you°, 4:32 and become° kind to one another,
affectionate, forgiving* others in yourselves, just-as God also forgave* us in Christ.

Christ also loved* us and gave himself up on our behalf as an offering and a sacrifice to God *for an
aroma of a sweet-fragrance.
      5:3
          But do not let fornication and all uncleanness or greed even be named among you°, as is
suitable to holy-ones; 5:4 and do not allow obscenity, and foolish-talk or petty jesting, which are not
proper, but rather thanksgiving. 5:5 For* this you° are knowing, that every fornicator, or unclean
person, or greedy person, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and
God. 5:6 Let no one deceive you° with empty words; for* because of these things the wrath of God is
coming upon the sons of disobedience. 5:7 Therefore, do° not become joint partakers with them. 5:8
For* you° were previously in darkness, but now you° are light in the Lord. Walk° as children of light
5:9
    (for* the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 5:10 testing what is well
pleasing to the Lord. 5:11 And have° no fellowship together-with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
also rather reprove° them, 5:12 for* it is shameful even to speak of the things happening by them
covertly. 5:13 But all things which are reproved, are manifested by the light, for* everything which is

manifested is light. 5:14 Hence he says, Arise, he who is sleeping, and rise* up from the dead and the
Christ will appear upon you.
    5:15
         Therefore, beware° how accurately you° are walking, not as unwise, but as wise, 5:16 buying up
the time, because the days are evil. 5:17 Because of this, do° not become foolish, but understand what
the will of the Lord is. 5:18 And do° not be drunken with wine, in which there is riotousness, but be°
filled in the Spirit, 5:19 speaking to yourselves in psalms and in hymns and in spiritual songs, singing
and singing-praise in your° heart to the Lord; 5:20 giving-thanks always on behalf of all things in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and Father; 5:21 and being subject to one another in the fear of
Christ.
    5:22
         The wives subject° yourselves to your° own husbands, as to the Lord, 5:23 because the husband
is the head of the wife as Christ is also the head of the congregation* of believers; he himself is the
savior of the body. 5:24 But just-like the congregation* is subject to the Christ, so let the wives also
be subject to their own husbands in all things.
    5:25
         The husbands, love*° your° own wives, just-as the Christ also loved* the congregation* and gave
himself up on her behalf, 5:26 in-order-that he might make her holy, having cleansed her in the full-
washing of the water in the word, 5:27 in-order-that he might present her to himself, the glorious
congregation*, not having stain or wrinkle or any such things, but in-order-that she should be holy
and unblemished. 5:28 So the husbands ought to love* their own wives as their own bodies. He who
loves* his own wife loves* himself. 5:29 For* no one ever hated his own flesh, but is nourishing and
cherishing it, just-as the Lord also does the congregation* of believers, 5:30 because we are members
of his body, out-of his flesh and out-of his bones. 5:31 Because of this, a man will be leaving his father
and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will be joined into one flesh. {Gen 2:24} 5:32
This mystery is great, but I am speaking in regard to Christ and in regard to the congregation* of
believers. 5:33 However to you° also, let each, every one, thus love* his own wife like himself, and let
the wife see that* she should fear {i.e., respect} the husband.

be getting this from the Lord, whether bondservant or free man. 6:9 And the lords, do*° the same
things toward them and be lax with the threatening, knowing that your° own Lord is also their Lord

Clothe° yourselves with the full-armor of God, in order for you* to be able to stand up to the schemes
of the devil. 6:12 Because the wrestling in us is not with blood and flesh, but with the principalities,
with the authorities, with the world dominions of the darkness of this age, with the spiritual ones of
wickedness in the heavenly places. 6:13 Because of this, take° up the full-armor of God, in-order-that
you° may be able to stand against the devil in the evil day, and to stand straight, having worked

be given to me, in opening my mouth to make known the mystery of the good-news in boldness, 6:20
on behalf of which, I am an emissary in a chain, in-order-that I should speak boldly in it, as it is

                                          {{ Introduction to Philippians 62-64 AD
   Paul, still in prison, writes a long, encouraging letter that has very few sentences dealing with problems or possible
problems, one is two women who are making some kind of disturbance. Paul tells them to be of the same mind a
commandment he tells all the Christians in all his letters. All Christians should strive to be the congregation, which obeys
the commands of Jesus and not the traditions of men, fulfill Jesus’ prayer for unity (Joh 17). He speaks about his
evangelism of all the palace guard. You might say he had a ‘captive audience’ with ‘the whole palace guard and to all
the rest.’ You get to see a lot of Paul’s human side, his emotions, and concern for all the congregations and his desire
to make sure someone is sent to them in his place. Paul does a rebuke to the ‘mutilation,’ i.e., the Jewish Christian false
teachers in chapter 3. Some of the best advice that could be given to a Christian, ‘forgetting the things which are behind
me and stretching forth to the things which are before me.’ He ends with the usual greeting and encouragements.}}

    1:1
         Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, to all the holy-ones in Christ Jesus who are
in Philippi, together-with the overseers and deacons {1Ti 3, Tit 1}: 1:2 grace to you° and peace from
God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
     1:3
         I am giving-thanks to my God upon every remembrance of you°, 1:4 always in my every
supplication on behalf of all of you°, making* the supplication with joy, 1:5 upon your° fellowship in
the good-news from the first day till now. 1:6 I have confidence of this same thing, that he who began
a good work in you° will be completing it till the day of Jesus Christ; 1:7 just-as it is a righteous thing
for me to be mindful of this on behalf of all of you°, because I have you° in my heart, both in my
bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the good-news, all of you° being fellow partners with
me of the grace. 1:8 For* God is my witness, how I am longing-for all of you° in the affections of
Christ Jesus. 1:9 And I am praying for this: in-order-that your° love* may abound still more and more
in full knowledge and all your° senses; 1:10 *that* you° may approve the things which are carrying
more-value; in-order-that you° may be sincere and guilt-free in the day of Christ; 1:11 having been
filled with the fruits of righteousness, the ones which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and
praise of God.
    1:12
         Now brethren, I am planning for you° to know, that the things against me have come rather *for
the progress of the good-news; 1:13 so-then my bonds became apparent in Christ in the whole palace
and to all the rest; 1:14 and the most {i.e., majority} of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by
my bonds, even-more so to dare to speak fearlessly the word of God. 1:15 Some indeed are preaching
the Christ even because of envy and strife, but some also through their delight. 1:16 The ones are
indeed proclaiming the Christ out-of selfish ambition, not purely, assuming to bring more affliction
upon my bonds. 1:17 But the latter ones do it out-of love*, knowing that I am reserved *for the defense
of the good-news. 1:18 For* what then? Other-than Christ is proclaimed in every manner: whether in
pretext or in truth. And I am rejoicing in this, but also, I will be rejoicing again. 1:19 For* I know that
this will be transpiring *for my salvation, through your° supplication and the supplying of the Spirit
of Jesus Christ, 1:20 according-to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will be shamed in nothing,
but as always, now Christ will also be magnified in my body in all boldness, whether through life
or through death. 1:21 For* to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 1:22 But if to live in the flesh, this
is the fruit of work to me, and what will I select for myself? I do not know. 1:23 Now I am very
troubled from the two ends, having the desire, *that* I should make my departure and be together-with
Christ, which is much better even more. 1:24 But to remain in the flesh is necessary because of you°.

1:25
     And having confidence of this, I know that I will remain, and I will be abiding together-with you°
all, *for your° progress and joy in the faith, 1:26 in-order-that your° boasting may abound in Christ
Jesus in me, through my presence with you° again. 1:27 Only behave-as° citizens worthy of the good-
news of the Christ, in-order-that, if I came and saw you° or even being absent, I may hear about the
things concerning you°, that you° are standing-firm in one spirit, with one soul contending together-
with us in the faith of the good-news, 1:28 and being terrified in nothing by the ones who lay in
opposition to you° (which to them indeed is an example of destruction, but to you° is an example of
salvation and this thing is from God, 1:29 because it was granted to you° on behalf of Christ, not only
to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf), 1:30 having the same struggle such-as you° saw in
me, and now are hearing to be in me.

     2:1
         Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love*, if any fellowship
of the Spirit, if any affections and mercies, 2:2 fulfill° my joy, in-order-that you° may be mindful of
the same thing, having the same love*, fellowship in spirit*, being mindful of the one thing, 2:3
nothing according-to selfish ambition or empty conceit, but in humility: deeming one another
superior to yourselves, 2:4 each one, do° not note the things of yourselves, but each one note also the
things of others. 2:5 For* let this mindset be in you°, which was also in Christ Jesus, 2:6 who, existing
in the form of God, did not deem it a seizure to be equal to God, 2:7 but emptied himself, having
taken the form of a bondservant, when he became in the likeness of men; 2:8 and having been found
in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, when he became obedient* as far as death, and even death
of a cross. 2:9 Hence, God also highly exalted him, and granted to him the name, the one above every
name; 2:10 in-order-that every knee should bow in the name of Jesus, those from the heavenly and
earthly and subterranean places, 2:11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.
     2:12
          So-then my beloved, just-as you° have always obeyed*, not only as in my presence, but now
much more in my absence, work° out your° own salvation with fear and trembling. 2:13 For* it is God
who is working in you° both to will and to work, on behalf of his delight. 2:14 Do*° all things without
murmurings and arguments, 2:15 in-order-that you° might become blameless and harmless children
of God, flawless in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you° appear as
illuminations in the world. 2:16 Keep holding onto the word of life, *for a boasting to me in the day
of Christ, that I did not run in vain nor labored in vain. 2:17 But even if I am a drink-offering upon the
sacrifice and ministry* of your° faith, I am rejoicing, and even rejoicing together-with you° all. 2:18
Now you° also, rejoice° and rejoice° together-with me in the same thing.
     2:19
          Now I am hoping in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you° shortly, in-order-that I may also
be in good-spirits after I knew about the things concerning you°. 2:20 For* I have no one equal in
spirit*, who will be genuinely anxious about the things concerning you°. 2:21 For* they are all seeking
their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. 2:22 But you° know the trial of him, that as a child serves a
father, so he served* together-with me *for the good-news. 2:23 Therefore, I am indeed hoping to send
this one promptly, as I would look away from the things around me {i.e., figuring out what to do next},
2:24
      but I have confidence in the Lord that I myself will also be coming shortly.

     2:25
          But I deemed it necessary to send to you° Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and
fellow soldier, and your° ambassador* and minister* to my need, 2:26 since he was longing-for you° all,
and was disheartened because you° had heard that he was sick. 2:27 For* he also was sick, close to
death. But God showed-mercy on him, now not him only, but also me, in-order-that I might not have
sorrow upon sorrow. 2:28 Therefore, I sent him more diligently, in-order-that having seen him again,
you° should rejoice and that* I may be sorrow-free. 2:29 Therefore, accept° him in the Lord with all joy,
and hold° the ones who are such as admired, 2:30 because he drew near almost as far as death, because
of the work of the Christ, having disregarded the life, he had, in-order-that he might fill the lack in
your° ministry* toward me.

     3:1
         Furthermore, my brethren, rejoice° in the Lord. Indeed, it is not tedious for me to write the same
things to you°, but a secure thing for you°. 3:2 Beware° of the dogs; beware° of the evil workers;
beware° of the mutilation. 3:3 For* we are the circumcision, who are giving-divine-service in the spirit
of God, and boasting in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh; 3:4 although I also have
confidence in the flesh; if any other is thinking to have confidence in the flesh, I have more. 3:5 An
eighth day circumcision from the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew out-of Hebrews;
according-to the law, a Pharisee; 3:6 according-to zeal, I was persecuting the congregation* of
believers; according-to the righteousness in the law, I became blameless. 3:7 But what things were
gains for me, I have deemed these a forfeiture because of the Christ. 3:8 But therefore, I am also
deeming all things indeed to be a forfeiture because of the superiority of the knowledge of Christ
Jesus my Lord, because of whom, I forfeited all things, and am deeming them to be assorted trashes
in-order-that I may gain Christ, 3:9 and may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which is
from the law, but which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is from God upon the
faith, 3:10 to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being
transformed to his death; 3:11 if somehow I may achieve to the resurrection out-of the dead. 3:12 Not
that I have already received it or have already been completed in this, but I am pursuing it, if I might
grab upon what I was also grabbed by Christ Jesus. 3:13 Brethren, I myself do not reason to have
grabbed it, but indeed forgetting one thing, that is the things which are behind me and stretching
forth to the things which are before me. 3:14 I am pursuing, according-to the goal line, at the prize of
the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus. 3:15 Therefore, as many as are mature, we should be
mindful of this, and if you° are mindful of anyone differently, God will also be revealing this to you°;
3:16
     however in what we have attained, we are to march by the same standard*, to be mindful of the
same thing.
     3:17
          Brethren, become° joint imitators of me, and note° the ones walking so, just-as you° have us
as an example. 3:18 For* many are walking (of whom I was speaking to you° often about them; now
I am also saying again to you°, weeping), who are the enemies of the cross of Christ, 3:19 whose end
is destruction, whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame, who are mindful of earthly
things. 3:20 For* our citizenship exists in the heavens; from where we are also waiting for a Savior,
the Lord Jesus Christ, 3:21 who will fashion the body of our humbleness, *that* it may become
transformed to the body of his glory, according-to the working of him to be able to even subject all
things to himself.

        But I have greatly rejoiced in the Lord, that now as previously, you° bloomed again the desire
to be mindful of things on my behalf; in which, you° were even mindful of me, but you° had no
opportunity. 4:11 Not that I am speaking according-to my lack of things; for* I have learned in which
things I am to be content. 4:12 I know how to be also humbled; I also know how to also abound. I have
been initiated in everything, and in all things, both to be fully-fed and to be hungry, both to abound
and to lack. 4:13 I am strong in all things in Christ in the one empowering me.

you Philippians, that in the beginning of the good-news, when I went forth from Macedonia, no
congregation* shared with me in the word {i.e., matter. Or: speech. Or: The Word} of the giving and
receiving, except you° only. 4:16 Because even in Thessalonica, you° sent once and then twice to my
need. 4:17 Not that I am seeking after the present, but I am seeking after the fruit which increases to
your° account. 4:18 But I fully have all things, and I am abounding. I have been filled, having accepted
from Epaphroditus the things which came from you°, an aroma of a sweet-fragrance, an acceptable
sacrifice, well pleasing to God. 4:19 Now my God will be filling every need of yours° according-to his
riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 4:20 Now to our God and Father is the glory forevermore. Amen.
   4:21
         Greet° every holy-one in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are together-with me greet you°. 4:22
All the holy-ones greet you°, but especially the ones who are from the house of Caesar.

                                          {{ Introduction to Colossians 62-64 AD
    The Colossians had a ‘pastor’ problem, a one-man self-righteous false teacher, most likely a Jewish Christian with
‘persuasive speech’ who wanted the congregation to follow his teachings and not the teachings of the Christ given to
them by Paul. There are reasons, as shown here, why God did not establish a democracy or a dictatorship in the
congregation, but multiple shepherds (overseers, elders, etc. Philippians 1:2, Tim. 3, Titus 1). An inspired description
of this man, without naming him and strong rebuke in Chapter 2:8-23. In this a teaching that immersion cleaned away
their sins, trespasses, and killed the Old Testament Law ‘having nailed it to the cross.’ He uses the same type of example
here as he did in Rom 6. In Chapter 3, now that you have been raised up from the dead do away with old sinful things
and replace them with holy things. Do all in the name of Jesus; (do only what is authorized). A short encouragement to
the married, children, bondservants (workers), and employers. Some simple instruction to them and the plans to send
others in his place to continue to help them grow.
    We can learn a valuable lesson from this letter to never exalt or follow any man, as well as how to live as a Christian.
Hero worship has no place with Christians and should be condemned by all.}}

     1:1
         Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy the brother, 1:2 to the holy
and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse: grace to you° and peace from God our Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ.
      1:3
          We are giving-thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying
concerning you°, 1:4 having heard of your° faith in Christ Jesus and of the love* which you° have
toward all the holy-ones, 1:5 because of the hope which is laying up for you° in the heavens, of which
you° heard beforehand in the word of the truth of the good-news. 1:6 This good-news is what is
present* *for you°; just-as it also is in all the world. And it is bearing-fruit and growing in yourselves,
just-as it also does in you°, from the day you° heard and fully knew the grace of God in truth, 1:7 just-
as you° also learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow bondservant, who is a faithful servant of the
Christ on your° behalf, 1:8 who also indicated to us your° love* in the Spirit.
     1:9
         Because of this, we also do not cease praying and asking on your° behalf from the day we heard
it in-order-that you° may be filled with the full knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and
intelligence, 1:10 for you° to walk worthy of the Lord toward pleasing him in everything, bearing-fruit
in every good work and growing yourselves into the full knowledge of God; 1:11 being empowered
in all power, according-to the dominion of his glory, *for all endurance and patience with joy; 1:12
giving-thanks to the Father, who made us sufficient *for the part of the inheritance of the holy-ones
in the light, 1:13 who rescued us out-of the authority of darkness and transplanted us into the kingdom
of the Son of his love*, 1:14 in whom we have the redemption, the forgiveness of sins {T} through his
blood, 1:15 he who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. 1:16 This is because
all things were created by him: the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible
and invisible, whether thrones or lordships or principalities or authorities. All things have been
created through him and *for him. 1:17 And he himself is before all things and all things are standing
{Or: established} in him. 1:18 And he himself is the head of the body, the congregation* of believers; who
is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead in-order-that he might become foremost in all things,
1:19
     because all the fullness was delighted to dwell in him, 1:20 and through him to reconcile all things
to himself, whether things upon the earth or things upon the heavens, having made peace through
the blood of his cross, through him. 1:21 And you° were being previously alienated and enemies in

present you° holy and unblemished and irreproachable in his sight, 1:23 if you° actually are remaining
in the faith, having been founded and grounded and not being moved away from the hope of the
good-news which you° heard, which was preached in all creation which is under heaven, of which
I, Paul, became a servant.
    1:24
         Now I am rejoicing in the sufferings of mine on your° behalf and I am filling up in my flesh
the things lacking of the afflictions of the Christ on behalf of his body, which is the congregation*
of believers, 1:25 of which I became a servant, according-to the stewardship of God which was given
to me *for you°, to fulfill the word of God, 1:26 the mystery which has been hidden away from the ages
and away from the generations, but now it was manifested to his holy-ones, 1:27 to whom God willed
to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, who is Christ
in you°, the hope of glory. 1:28 It is this Christ whom we are proclaiming, admonishing every man and
teaching every man in all wisdom in-order-that we should present every man as completed in Christ
Jesus; 1:29 *for which I also labor, struggling according-to his working, which works in power in me.

having been knitted together in love* and in all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, to
the full knowledge of the mystery of God and Father and of the Christ, 2:3 in whom all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge are hidden.
    2:4
        But I am saying all of this in-order-that not anyone may delude you° in persuasive speech. 2:5
For even if I am absent in the flesh, but yet I am together-with you° in the spirit, rejoicing and seeing
     *
your° order and the firmness of your° faith in Christ.
    2:6
        Therefore, as you° received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk° in him, 2:7 having been rooted and
being built up in him and being confirmed in the faith, just-as you° were taught in it, abounding in
thanksgiving.
    2:8
        Beware°, that there will not be anyone leading you° away as his prey through philosophy and
vain deception, according-to the tradition of men, according-to the elemental principles of the world,
and not according-to Christ, 2:9 because all the fullness of the Deity is dwelling in him bodily. 2:10 And
you° are fulfilled in him, who is the head of all principality and authority; 2:11 in whom you° were also
circumcised with a circumcision not made* with hands, in the stripping off of the body of the sins
of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ, 2:12 having been buried together-with him in the
immersion*, in which you° were also raised up together-with him through the faith from the working
of God, who raised him up from the dead. 2:13 And you°, being dead in your° trespasses and the
uncircumcision of the flesh, he made* you° alive together-with him, having forgiven* us all the
trespasses, 2:14 having wiped-away the handwriting in the decrees that were against us, which were
an adversary to us. He has also taken these out-of the midst of us, having nailed it to the cross, 2:15
having stripped off the principalities and the authorities, he publicly made a show of them, having
triumphed over them in it.

     2:16
          Therefore, do not let anyone judge you° in food, or in drink, or in this respect of a feast day,
or a new month, or Sabbaths, 2:17 which are a shadow of the future things, but the body is Christ’s.
2:18
      Let no one arbitrate against you°, willing it so in your° humility and in a religion of the
messengers, stepping you° further into the things which he has not seen, being vainly arrogant by his
mind of flesh, 2:19 and not holding-fast to the head, from whom all the body is being supplied and
knitted together through the joints and ligaments, which is growing with the growth of God.
     2:20
           If you° died together-with Christ away from the elemental principles of the world, why (as
though living in the world) are you° submissive to its decrees: 2:21 do not touch; do not taste; do not
handle; 2:22 which things in the using are all leading to corruption, according-to the commandments
and teachings of men? 2:23 Which things are indeed in a man-made religion holding a reason which
comes from man’s wisdom and humility and unsparing cruelty of the body, but are not in any value
toward the indulgence of the flesh.

where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 3:2 Be° mindful of the things above, not the things
upon the earth. 3:3 For* you° died and your° life has been hidden together-with the Christ in God. 3:4
Whenever the Christ, who is the life of us, should be manifested, then you° will also be manifested
together-with him in glory.
     3:5

passion, evil desire and greed, which is idolatry, 3:6 because of which things the wrath of God is
coming upon the sons of disobedience, 3:7 among whom you° also previously walked, when you° were
living in them. 3:8 But also now, place° all these things away from you°: anger, fury, malice,
blasphemy, obscene speech from your° mouth.
     3:9
         Do° not lie to one another, since you° have stripped off the old man together-with his practices,
3:10
      and have clothed yourselves with the new man, who is being renewed to the full knowledge
according-to the image of the one who created him, 3:11 where there is no Greek and Jew,
circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, or free man, but Christ is all
things and in all things.
     3:12
          Therefore, as chosen ones of God, holy and beloved, clothe° yourselves with a heart* of mercy,
kindness, humility, meekness, patience, 3:13 tolerating one another and forgiving* others in
yourselves. If anyone has a complaint toward anyone, just-as the Christ forgave* you°, so you° also
forgive* others. 3:14 But over all these things be clothed with the love*, which is the bond of maturity.
3:15
     And let the peace of God arbitrate in your° hearts, *for which you° were also called in one body,
and become° thankful. 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you° richly, in all wisdom, teaching and
admonishing yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing in gratitude in your° heart
to the Lord. 3:17 And everything, anything, whatever you° do* in word or in work, do all things in the

                                    {{ Introduction to 1 & 2 Thessalonians 52-53 AD
    The letter sent to a congregation in Thessalonica apparently who had problems with the teachings previously given
to them, which deals with what is typical, called the ‘Second Coming.’ They believed (wrongly) that Jesus was coming
back ‘like right now.’ One thing that false religious groups and ‘self-proclaimed’ (false) prophets have taught us in the
past 100 years or so is that no one knows when Jesus is coming back. Jesus did not even know. A very vivid picture is
given of how the judgment, revelation of the Lord, Jesus’ coming and the end occurs. Jesus and the messengers of God
would come with a sound of a trumpet (common in Greek history as a call to battle, that everyone could hear it) in
flaming fire. Christians will meet Jesus in the air 1Thessalonians 4:16-17, ‘those who are not obeying...the sentence of
everlasting utter-destruction’ in 2Thessalonians 1:7-9. The warning that the ‘man of sin’ would come first,
1Thessalonians 2, Caesar Nero (called 666 by John in Revelation 13:18) was a time that Christians would start suffering
persecution from the hands of the Roman government. A quick ‘to the point’ conclusion in 2Thessalonians 3 and a
commandment to stay away from those who do not teach ‘the tradition received from us.’ A commandment we hope all
Christians will obey by not following the ‘traditions of men’ and so save themselves from the ‘fire.’}}

endurance of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father, 1:4 knowing beloved

congregations* of God, which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you° also suffered the same things
by your° own countrymen, just-as they themselves also by the Jews. 2:15 The Jews, who both killed
the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and banished us, and were not pleasing to God, and are
adverse to all men, 2:16 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles in-order-that they might be saved, *that*
they should always fill up their sins; but the wrath has arrived-unexpectedly upon them to the end.

          But brethren, having been orphaned away from you° for the time of an hour, in face {i.e., person}

Timothy, our brother and God’s servant and our fellow worker in the good-news of the Christ, *that*
he might establish you° and to encourage you° concerning your° faith, 3:3 for no one to be shook up
in these afflictions; for* you° yourselves know that we are reserved *for this thing. 3:4 For* even when
we were with you°, we were saying to you° beforehand that we are about to be afflicted, just-as it also
happened and you° know. 3:5 Because of this, no longer forbearing it, I also sent Timothy, *that* I
might know your° faith, lest the tempter had tempted you°, and our labor might become vain. 3:6 But
now, Timothy came to us from you°, and proclaimed to us good-news about your° faith and love*,
and that you° have a good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, just-as we also long to see
you°. 3:7 Brethren, because of this, we were comforted upon the basis of you° in all our affliction and
calamity through your° faith, 3:8 because now we live, if you° stand-firm in the Lord. 3:9 For* what
thanksgiving are we able to repay to God concerning you°? Over all the joy in which we are rejoicing
before our God is because of you°, 3:10 exceptionally beseeching God night and day, *that* we may
see your° face and may mend the things lacking of your° faith.

this is the will of God, your° holiness, for you° to abstain from fornication, 4:4 for each of you° to
know how to procure his own vessel in holiness and honor, 4:5 not in the passion of lust, just-as also
the Gentiles who do not know God; 4:6 and not to go-beyond-limits and take-advantage of his brother
in the matter, because the Lord is an avenger concerning all these things, just-as we also foretold to
you° and thoroughly testified. 4:7 For* God did not call us to uncleanness, but in holiness. 4:8
Therefore, the one rejecting this is not rejecting man, but God, who also gave his Holy Spirit to you°.
    4:9
         Now concerning brotherly-love, you° have no need for someone to write to you°; for* you°
yourselves are taught by God, *that* you° should love* one another; 4:10 for* you° are also practicing
it toward all the brethren who are in the whole of Macedonia. But brethren, we encourage you° to
abound even more, 4:11 and to make it your° aim to be living quiet lives and to do* your° own things,
and to work with your° own hands (just-as we commanded you°), 4:12 in-order-that you° may walk
decently toward the ones who are outside, and may have need of nothing.

    4:13
         But brethren, we do not wish you° to be ignorant concerning the ones who have fallen-asleep;
in-order-that you° may not also be sorrowful like the rest who have no hope. 4:14 For* if we believe
that Jesus died and then rose* up, so the ones who fell-asleep through Jesus, God will also be
bringing* together-with him. 4:15 For* this we are saying to you° in the word of the Lord, that we, the
living, who are left at the presence of the Lord, should never attain heaven before the ones who fell-
asleep. 4:16 Because the Lord himself will be descending from heaven, in a commanding yell, in the
voice of the archangel and at the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will be rising* up first; 4:17
thereafter we, the living, who are left, will be seized at the same-time together-with them in the
clouds, to the encounter of the Lord in the air, and so we will always be together-with the Lord. 4:18
So-then, encourage° one another in these words.

the seasons. 5:2 For* you° yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord so comes like a thief
in the night. 5:3 For* whenever they say, Peace and security, then sudden utter-destruction stands by
them, just-like the travail a woman has in her womb, and they should never flee away from it. 5:4 But
brethren, you° are not in darkness in-order-that the day might overtake you° like a thief. 5:5 You° are
all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night, nor of darkness. 5:6 Therefore,
consequently*, we should not sleep, like the rest also do, but let us watch and be sober. 5:7 For* the
ones sleeping, they sleep by night; and the ones who are drunken, they are drunken by night. 5:8 But
we, being of the day, should be sober, having clothed yourselves with the breastplate of faith and
love*, and a helmet, the hope of salvation. 5:9 Because God appointed* us not *for wrath, but *for the
acquisition of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 5:10 who died on our behalf, in-order-that,

admonish° the disorderly, console° the fainthearted, hold° up the weak, have° patience toward all. 5:15
See° that not anyone should repay evil in exchange-for evil to anyone, but always pursue° the good,

     Do° not scorn prophecies. 5:21 Now test° all things. Hold-onto° the good things. 5:22 Abstain° from

soul and body be kept blameless in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. 5:24 He is faithful who calls
you°, who will also do* it.

working of error, *that* they should believe in the lie, 2:12 in-order-that they all might be judged who
did not believe in the truth, but were delighted in unrighteousness.

                                         {{ Introduction to 1 Timothy 63-64 AD
    This was written after Paul was released from his first two-year imprisonment in Rome, which is mentioned in Acts
28:30, 31.
Paul wants the reader to gain knowledge about God’s instructions to preachers, prayer, the role of women, qualifications
of elders and deacons, proper treatment of various categories of people, the importance of the right example and more.
Timothy receives this letter from Paul and Paul took Timothy with him on other journeys (Acts 16:3-5). However, the
writing is to give instructions and encouragement to Timothy and all other men who would preach the Good-news and
to stress the necessity of preaching and teaching the sound doctrine (i.e., the Good-news of Christ, without adding to or
taking away from it). To identify the need to wage the good spiritual warfare against Satan, including resisting and
rebuking the ones who teach false doctrine. Paul addresses prayer, submission of women, qualifications of the men for
the eldership or servants such as deacons. We also see instructions on the proper treatment of older and younger men
and women, including widows and elders. Instruction and strong warning and exhortation to the ones who desire to be
rich and to the ones who actually are rich in this world’s goods.}}

Jesus Christ, our hope; 1:2 to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith: grace, mercy, peace, from God
our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
     1:3
         As I encouraged you to remain in Ephesus, while I was traveling into Macedonia, in-order-that
you might command to some not to teach a different teaching, 1:4 nor to take-heed to fables and
unending genealogies, which provide more debates, rather than a stewardship of God which is in
faith. 1:5 But the end of the command is love* out-of a clean heart and a good conscience and a non-
pretended faith, 1:6 from which some having deviated, turned themselves aside to empty-talking, 1:7
wishing to be teachers of the law, not perceiving neither what they are saying nor the things
concerning what they are confidently confirming. 1:8 But we know that the law is good, if anyone
uses it lawfully, 1:9 knowing this: that law is not laid down {Or: reserved} for the righteous, but for the
lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for killers of their
fathers and killers of their mothers, for murderers, 1:10 for fornicators, for homosexuals, for
kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers and if any other thing which lays in opposition to sound* teaching,

      according-to the good-news of the glory of the blessed* God, to which I was entrusted.
      1:12
           And I have gratitude to the one who empowered me, namely, the Christ, Jesus our Lord,
because he deemed me faithful, having placed me into his service, 1:13 even though being a former
blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man, but I was shown-mercy, because being ignorant,
I practiced it in unbelief; 1:14 and the grace of our Lord overwhelmed me with the faith and love*
which is in Christ Jesus. 1:15 Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost. 1:16 But I was shown-mercy because of this,
in-order-that Jesus Christ might show all his patience in me as foremost, for a pattern of the ones
who are afterward about to believe on him *for everlasting life. 1:17 Now to the King of the ages,
incorruptible, invisible, the only wise God, is honor and glory forevermore. Amen.

congregation’s leadership, described in various Bible versions and locations within as: elders, bishops, overseers, pastors,
shepherds, presbyters; (all terms are always plural in the Bible). These words do not translate well into English. They

house, how will he be caring for the congregation* of God?); 3:6 not a new-convert (in-order-that

are translated ‘serve,’ ‘servant,’ or ‘service’ (see 3:10 & 3:13). Because ‘elder’ (‘overseer’ in Php 1:1) a known office
of the congregation is used, this context calls for an office or serving position in the congregation. The actual word in
Greek means ‘servant’ who serves in reference to his job. The same word is used by Paul to describe a ‘policeman’ (in
modern terms) in Rm. 13:4. Context could also mean ‘the ones who minister,’ in general. Other Greek synonyms in the
MLV are translated as: ‘domestic servant,’ ‘attendant,’ ‘minister*’ and ‘bondservant.’}

    Also command these things in-order-that they may be unimpeachable. 5:8 But if anyone is not {F}
planning-for his own and especially the ones of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse
than an unbelieving person. {Or: provide; or: planning in the short term.}
     5:9
         Do not let a widow be enrolled who is less-than sixty years old, who had become the wife of
one man, 5:10 being testified of in good works; if she reared children, if she was hospitable to
strangers, if she washed the holy-ones’ feet, if she relieved those being afflicted, if she followed after
every good work.
     5:11
          But renounce younger widows, for* whenever they are promiscuous against the Christ, they
wish to marry, 5:12 having condemnation, because they rejected their first faith. 5:13 Now at the same-
time, they also are learning to be idle, strolling the houses, and not only idle, but also gossips and
busybodies, speaking things which it is not essential to be speaking. 5:14 Therefore, I will the younger
widows to marry, to be childbearing, to manage the house, to not give a starting-point to the one who
lays in opposition to them because of reviling; 5:15 for* some have already turned themselves aside
after the Adversary.
     5:16
          If any believing man or believing woman has relatives who are widows, let this one relieve
them and do not let the congregation* be burdened, in-order-that it may relieve the widows who
really are widows.
     5:17
          The elders who are governing well, let° them be deemed worthy of double honor, especially
the ones laboring in the word and in teaching. 5:18 For* the Scripture says, ‘You will not muzzle a
threshing bull.’ {Deu 25:4} And, ‘The worker is worthy of his wages.’ {Lev 19:13} 5:19 Do not accept
an accusation against an elder {Or: elderly man}, unless upon the testimony of two or three witnesses.
5:20
     Reprove the ones sinning in the sight of all in-order-that the rest may also have fear. 5:21 I am
thoroughly testifying in sight of God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the chosen messengers in-order-
that you should observe these things without prejudice, doing* nothing according-to bias. 5:22 Lay
hands upon no one quickly, nor share in another’s sins. Keep yourself pure! 5:23 No longer be a
drinker of water only, but use a small amount of wine because of your stomach and your frequent
sicknesses. 5:24 Some men’s sins are evident, leading them into judgment, but even for some, they are
also following after them later. 5:25 Likewise* also, the good works are evident, and the ones having
works contrariwise are not able to be hidden.

have believing masters, let° them not despise them, because they are brethren, but rather let° them
serve* them, because they are believing and beloved who are helped from the good* work. Teach and
encourage these things.
     6:3
          If anyone is teaching a different teaching and is not coming near to sound* words, even the
words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the teaching, the one according-to devoutness, 6:4 he has been
puffed up, knowing nothing, but being mentally diseased concerning debates and quarrels over
words, out-of which become: envy, strife, blasphemies, evil suspicions, 6:5 incessant wranglings of
men who have been corrupted in the mind and who have been deprived of the truth, supposing
devoutness to be a method to earnings. Withdraw from such ones.
     6:6
         But devoutness with contentment is a great method to earnings, 6:7 for* we brought nothing into
the world, nor is it evident that we are able to carry anything out; {Job 1:21} 6:8 but we will be content
with these things, having nourishments and clothes. 6:9 But the ones planning to be rich are falling
into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts, which are submerging men into
utter-destruction and everlasting destruction. 6:10 For* the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils,
of which some aspiring to, were misled from the faith and they themselves are staked-through by
many sorrows.
     6:11
           But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, devoutness, faith, love*,
endurance, meekness. 6:12 Fight the good fight of the faith, grab the everlasting life, to which you
were called and professed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses. 6:13 I am commanding
you in God’s sight, who gives-life to all things and of Christ Jesus, who in front of Pontius Pilate
testified the good confession; 6:14 for you to keep the commandment, unstained, unimpeachable, till
the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. 6:15 Which in their own times, he will show, the Blessed* and
only Sovereign, the King of the ones who are reigning, and a Lord of the ones who have lordship
over others; 6:16 he who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no one from
mankind saw, nor is able to see: to whom is honor and everlasting dominion. Amen.
     6:17
           Command the rich in the current age, not to be cavalier, nor to have hope on the uncertainty
of riches, but have hope in the living God, who is richly providing to us all things toward enjoyment;
6:18
      also command them to work what is good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal in giving,
generous, 6:19 storing up for themselves a good foundation toward the future, in-order-that they may
grab the everlasting life.

          O Timothy, guard the deposit consigned to you, turning yourself away from the profane empty-
talks and oppositions of the falsely named knowledge; 6:21 which some professing have deviated
concerning the faith.
     Grace be with you. Amen.

    Paul wrote this Letter to Timothy (1:2) and taught Timothy the Good-news, and they did a great deal of work together
preaching the Good-news. To give instructions and encouragement to Timothy and all future preachers and teachers of
not being ashamed of God’s word, and to hold fast to the pattern of sound words delivered by Paul and other apostles
and prophets. Being strong and endure hardship and suffering as a good soldier of Christ and willing to endure all things
for the chosen, that they may obtain the salvation which is in Christ. Being a diligent worker, rightly dividing the word
of truth, carefully following sound doctrine and continuing to live in it. Being watchful, endure affliction and do the work
of an evangelist and beware of false teachers because false doctrine spreads and kills like cancer, undermining the work
of faithful preachers, but most of all, fighting the good fight, keep the faith and finish the race in Christ looking forward
to the crown of righteousness.}}

         I have gratitude to God, to whom I am giving-divine-service from my ancestors in a clean
conscience, as I have constant remembrance concerning you in my supplications, night and day. 1:4
I am longing to see you, having been reminded of your tears, in-order-that I may be filled from your
joy, 1:5 receiving a reminder of the non-pretended faith, the one in you, which dwelt first in your
grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I also have confidence that it is in you. 1:6 Because
of which case, I am reminding you to rekindle the gift* of God, which is in you through the laying
on of my hands. 1:7 For* God did not give to us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and love* and self-
discipline. 1:8 Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor me, his prisoner, but
suffer-hardship together-with the good-news according-to the power of God, 1:9 who saved us and
called us with a holy calling, not according-to our works, but according-to his own purpose and
grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times everlasting. 1:10 But now it was manifested
through the appearing of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who indeed did-away-with death and illuminated
both life and incorruption through the good-news, 1:11 to which I was appointed* a preacher and an
apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles. 1:12 Because of which case, I also am suffering these things too,
but I am not ashamed, for* I know the one whom I have believed and I have confidence that he is
able to guard my deposit consigned to him *for that day. 1:13 Hold to the pattern of sound* words

    No active soldier entangles himself in the tradeoffs of this life {Or: occupations of civilian life.}, in-
order-that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. 2:5 And if anyone should also contend
in the games, he is not crowned if he has not contended lawfully. 2:6 It is essential that the farmer
who labors to receive of the fruits first. 2:7 Perceive which things I am saying, for* the Lord may give
you intelligence in all things. 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, who has been raised from the dead, was
born out-of the seed of David, according-to my good-news, 2:9 in which I am suffering evil treatment,
even as far as bonds, like a criminal; but the word of God has not been bound. 2:10 Because of this,
I endure all things, because of the chosen, in-order-that they themselves may also obtain the salvation
which is in Christ Jesus with everlasting glory. 2:11 Faithful is the word: for* if we died together-with
him, we will also be living together-with him; 2:12 if we endure, we will also be reigning together-with
him; if we are denying him, he will also be denying us; 2:13 if we are unfaithful, that one is remaining
faithful; he is not able to deny himself.

          Remind them of these things, thoroughly testifying in the sight of the Lord, that they are not
to quarrel over words, which is useful in nothing, ending in catastrophe of the ones hearing them. 2:15
Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed worker, cutting-straight {Or: handling
correctly} the word of truth. 2:16 But avoid profane empty-talks, for* they will progress over to more
ungodliness, 2:17 and their word will hold an eating-away like gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and
Philetus, 2:18 who deviated concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is to have already
happened and are perverting the faith of some.
     2:19
          Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal, ‘The Lord knew the ones
who are his,’ {Num 16:5} and ‘Let everyone who names the name of the Lord withdraw away from
unrighteousness.’ {Isa 26:13}
    2:20
          Now there are not only golden and silver vessels in a great house, but also wooden and baked-
clay, and indeed what things to honor and what things to dishonor. 2:21 Therefore, if anyone should
cleanse himself away from these things, he will be a vessel *for honor, having been made holy and
is useful to the master, having been prepared *for every good work.
     2:22
          But flee the youthful lusts, but pursue righteousness, faith, love*, and peace, with the ones
calling upon the Lord out-of a clean heart. 2:23 But renounce foolish and non-instructive debates,
knowing that they give-birth to quarrels. 2:24 But it is essential for the Lord’s bondservant to not
quarrel, but to be mild toward all, skilled in teaching, tolerating it when being mistreated, 2:25 in
meekness {F} educating the ones who are placing themselves in opposition, if maybe God might give
them repentance to come to the full knowledge of the truth, 2:26 and they might sober up out-of the
snare of the devil, having been caught live by him to that man’s will.

   This letter was written after Paul was released from his first two-year imprisonment in Rome (Acts 28:30, 31). It was
written to provide instructions and encouragement to Titus and to all men who preach the Good-news and to set in order
things that are lacking in any congregation of Christ as well as to give some qualifications of elders (1Tim. 3 also). He
also points out the importance of exhorting and convicting false teachers. He is stressing the necessity of teaching and
preaching sound doctrine as well as to bring to mind the kindness, love, mercy, and grace of God focusing on blessings
of being saved from sin, justified, redeemed, purified, God’s own special people and heirs of God so the Christian can
have hope. No wonder Paul described Titus as his partner and fellow worker!}

irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having believing children, who is not in an accusation of
riotousness or rebellious. 1:7 For* it is essential for the overseer to be irreproachable as God’s steward;
not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not a drunkard, not a bully, not covetous; 1:8 but hospitable, who

which it is not essential to teach, because of shameful gain. 1:12 Someone from them, a prophet of
their own, said, Cretans habitually are liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons. 1:13 This testimony is true*.
Because of which case, reprove them sharply, in-order-that they may be sound* in the faith, 1:14 not

    Paul writes the letter, not to a congregation(s) in an area but Philemon, the owner of a runaway bondservant,
Onesimus. The non- Christian bondservant met Paul in Rome who taught him the truth, and he became a Christian and
good friend of Paul. Paul was sending Onesimus back to Philemon, but he wants Philemon to treat this bondservant now
like a brother in Christ. Paul even says he personally will compensate if need be. However, it is doubtful Philemon ever
asked for it considering he was also taught the truth by Paul and, as you will see Paul being Paul in this short letter.}}

     1:1
         Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus and Timothy the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow
worker, 1:2 and to the beloved Apphia and to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the congregation*
in your house: 1:3 grace to you° and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
     1:4
         I am always giving-thanks to my God, making* a remembrance of you in my prayers, 1:5 hearing
of your love* and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the holy-ones; 1:6
*
  that the fellowship of your faith might become effective in the full knowledge of every good thing,
the good in us, to Christ Jesus. 1:7 For* we have much gratitude and comfort in your love*, because
the heart* of the holy-ones have been given-rest through you, brother.
     1:8
         Hence, having much boldness in Christ to command you what is proper, 1:9 but because of love*
I would rather encourage you, being such a one as Paul the elderly-man and now also a prisoner of
Jesus Christ. 1:10 I am encouraging you concerning my child, whom I fathered in my bonds,
Onesimus, 1:11 the one not useful to you previously, but who is useful to you now and to me, whom
I sent back to you. 1:12 But you, receive him, this is my heart*, 1:13 whom I was planning to hold here
for myself, in-order-that he might serve me in the bonds of the good-news on your behalf. 1:14 But
I wished to do* nothing without your viewpoint; in-order-that as your good deed may not be
according-to necessity, but according-to your voluntary deed. 1:15 For* perhaps because of this, he was
separated from you for a short-time, in-order-that you may fully have him in the everlasting world;
1:16
      no longer as a bondservant, but beyond a bondservant, a beloved brother, especially to me, but
how-much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 1:17 Therefore, if you have me like a
partner, receive him like me. 1:18 But if he wronged you in anything or owes you anything, charge this
to my account. 1:19 I, Paul, wrote this with my own hand. I will be compensating you; in-order-that
I may not say to you, You are even owing yourself to me. 1:20 Yes, brother, may I derive benefit from
you in the Lord. Give-rest to my heart* in the Lord.
     1:21
           I wrote to you, having confidence in your obedience, knowing that you will be doing* even
beyond what I am saying. 1:22 But also at the same-time, prepare me a lodging. For* I am hoping that
through your° prayers I will be granted to you°.

                                          {{ Introduction to Hebrews 65-66 AD
   The book of Hebrew gives direction to the Jewish Christians; building on their common knowledge of Jewish Law
and traditions, the book furthers their comprehension of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. Using the Law as a shadow of the
things that have happened in their sight.
   It is important to realize how difficult it was for "Children of Abraham" to shove aside generations of teachings and
the marvelous acts of God recorded in their history. The miraculous confirmations happening among them got their
attention, but they must understand all the fulfilling of recorded prophecies.
   The author would have referred to the destruction of Jerusalem had it been written after AD 70, also references in the
present tense is used when speaking of worship in the Temple. (5.3, 10.1) It probably was written after the first
generation of Christians. (2.3) “having received it in the beginning when spoken through the Lord, which was confirmed
to us by the ones who heard it?” We lean toward the idea that Paul actually wrote Hebrews and it would have been about
65-66 AD, right before his death. There have been many speculations on the authorship, all the way from Paul, Luke,
Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Apollos, and Silvanus. However, what was seen in the early writings has Paul as the author.
We can understand at this point in life not to have his name inside. However, more importantly, God is the final authority
over His Written Word.
   Hebrews is a book of encouragement, exhortation, but contains strong warnings. Powerful beginning, “God, who long-
ago spoke, in many parts and in many manners, in the prophets to the fathers, has in the end of these days, spoken to us
in his Son.“
   Hebrews shows the proper relationship between the Old and New Testaments and explains clearly the Old Testament
passages and ideas. It also demonstrates the superiority of the Good-news of Jesus’. It was written to prevent apostasy
from Christianity back into Judaism by showing the Good-news is superior to Judaism (a God-given religion) and by
showing perfection and finality of Christ’s priesthood. Hebrews also shows how Jesus was the Christ to the non-believer
and as the fulfillment of many Old Testament prophecies. It was a final attempt for the Jews to be saved before their
massacre in the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD and the end of the now false Jewish religion.}}
                                                    [Hebrews 1] TOC
    1:1
         God spoke long-ago in many parts and in many manners, in the prophets to the fathers, and
spoke to us upon the last of these days in his Son, 1:2 whom he appointed* heir of all things, through
whom also he made* the ages, 1:3 who, being the brightness of his glory and the exact representation
of his essence, and is carrying all things by the declaration of his power. Having made* a cleansing
of our sins through himself, he sat down by the right hand of the Majesty in the high places, 1:4 when
he became so-much better than the messengers, inasmuch as he has inherited a more-excellent name
than they.
    1:5
        For* to what one of the messengers has he previously said, ‘You are my Son; I have fathered
you today.’ And again, ‘I will be a Father to him and he will be *for a Son to me.’ {Psa 2:7} 1:6 And
again, whenever he brings* in the firstborn into the inhabited-earth, he says, ‘And let° all the
messengers of God worship him.’ {Psa 89:26, 27} 1:7 And he indeed says toward the messengers, ‘Who
makes* his messengers, spirits, and his ministers*, a flame of fire.’ {Psa 104:4}
    1:8
        But he says toward the Son, ‘Your throne, O God, is forevermore; the scepter of uprightness
is the scepter of your kingdom. 1:9 You loved* righteousness and hated lawlessness. Because of this,
God, your God, anointed you with the oil of gladness more than your companions.’ 1:10 And, ‘You,
Lord, in the beginnings, founded the earth and the heavens are the works of your hands: 1:11 they
themselves will be perishing, but you are remaining and they will all become-obsolete like a
garment; 1:12 and you will coil them up like an outer dressing and they will be changed, but you are
the same and your years will not be failing.’ 1:13 But toward which of the messengers has he
previously said, ‘Sit at my right hand, until I should place your enemies as the footstool of your feet?

about to inherit salvation?
                                               [Hebrews 2] TOC
      2:1
          Because of this, it is essential for us to take-heed even-more to the things which were heard,
lest we might drift-away. 2:2 For* if the word which was spoken through the messengers became
steadfast and every transgression and disobedience* received a just reward, 2:3 how will we flee away,
having neglected so-great a salvation, which having received at the beginning, which was to be
spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by the ones who heard it? 2:4 God was testifying
together-with them, both with signs and with wonders and with various powers and with
distributions of the Holy Spirit, according-to his own will.
      2:5
          For* he did not subject the future inhabited-earth to messengers, concerning what we are
speaking. 2:6 But some writer thoroughly testified somewhere, saying, ‘What is man, that you
remember him? Or the son of man, that you visit him? 2:7 You made him a bit of something inferior
less than the messengers. You crowned him with glory and honor. {T} And stood him over the works
of your hands. 2:8 You subjected all things underneath his feet.’ {Psa 8:4-6} For* while* he was
subjecting all things to him, he left nothing which is not subject to him. But we now do not yet see
all things having been subjected to him. 2:9 But we see Jesus who has been made a bit of something
inferior, less than the messengers, having been crowned with glory and honor, because of the
suffering of the death he underwent,*that in the grace from God, he should taste of death on behalf
of everyone. 2:10 For* it was suitable for him, because of whom are all things and through whom are
all things, having led many sons to glory, to complete the author of their salvation through sufferings.
2:11
      For* both the one making him holy and the ones being made holy are all from one. Because of
which case, he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 2:12 saying, ‘I will be proclaiming your name to
my brethren, in the midst of the congregation* I will be singing hymns to you.’ 2:13 And again, ‘I will
have confidence in him.’ And again, ‘Behold, here I am and the children whom God gave me.’ {Psa
22:22, Psa 18:2, 2Sam. 22. 3, Isa 8:17-18}
     2:14
          Therefore, since the children have shared of flesh and blood, in like-manner he partook of the
same things, in-order-that through death, he might do-away-with the one having the dominion of
death (this is the devil) 2:15 and he might set-free these, as many as were in fear of death, who were
liable to bondage throughout all of their time to live. 2:16 For* surely he is not helping messengers,
but he is helping the seed of Abraham. 2:17 Hence he was obligated to be similar to the brethren
according-to all things, in-order-that he might become a merciful and faithful high-priest in the
things pertaining to God, *that* he should make atonement for the sins of the people. 2:18 For* in what
he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help with the ones being tempted.
                                               [Hebrews 3] TOC
     3:1
          Hence, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider° Jesus Christ, the Apostle and
High-Priest of our confession, 3:2 being faithful to the one who made* him such, as Moses also was
in his whole house. {Num 12:7} 3:3 For* this one has been deemed worthy of more glory than Moses,
inasmuch as the one who constructed it has more honor than the house. 3:4 For* every house is
constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God. 3:5 And Moses indeed was


mlvbible.org                                                                                                       337
faithful in his whole house as a bondservant *for a testimony of the things which will be spoken
later; 3:6 but Christ was faithful as a son, over his house, whose house we are, if indeed* we hold-onto
the boldness and the boasting of our hope steadfast till the end.
     3:7
         Hence, as the Holy Spirit says, ‘Today if you° hear his voice, 3:8 do not harden your° hearts, as
in the rebellion, according-to the day of the testing in the wilderness, 3:9 where your° fathers tested
me, they proved me, and then saw my works forty years. 3:10 Hence I was displeased with that
generation and said, They themselves are habitually misled in their hearts, but they did not know my
ways. 3:11 As I swore in my wrath, that they will never* be entering into my rest.’ {Num 14:22, Psa 95:7-
11; the ‘never*’ is actually ‘If’, located at the beginning of the Greek sentence. This is a Hebrew idiom: "IF they had
repented, they will enter... but now..." The Jews knew what they had to obey, but refused over and over again to obey
it.}
      3:12
           Beware° brethren, lest there will be an evil heart of unbelief in anyone of you°, in the
withdrawing away from the living God. 3:13 But encourage° yourselves each and every day, till what
is called today, in-order-that not anyone out-of you° may be hardened by the deception of sin. 3:14 For*
we have become companions of the Christ, if indeed* we hold-onto the beginning of our firmness
steadfast till the end, 3:15 while* it was said, ‘If you° hear his voice today, do not harden your° hearts,
as in the rebellion.’ {Num 14:29, Psa 95:7-11} 3:16 For* some having heard, rebelled, but not all the ones
who came forth out-of Egypt through Moses. 3:17 And with whom was he displeased for forty years?
Was it not with the ones who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? {Num 14:35} 3:18 Now
to whom had he sworn that they will not be entering into his rest, except to the ones who were
disobedient? 3:19 And we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
                                                   [Hebrews 4] TOC
     4:1
         Therefore, since a promise is left to enter into his rest, let us fear lest anyone out-of you° seem
to have come-short of it. 4:2 For* we also are having the good-news proclaimed to us, just-as they also
had. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not having been mingled together-with the faith
in those who heard it. 4:3 For* we who believed are entering into the same rest, just-as he has said,
‘As I have sworn in my wrath, that they will never* be entering into my rest,’ although the works
have happened from the conception of the world. {See Footnote on 3:11.} 4:4 For* he has thus said
somewhere concerning the seventh day, ‘And God rested on the seventh day from all his works’;
{Gen 2:2} 4:5 and again in this one, ‘That if they will be entering into my rest.’ {Psa 95:7-11, Num 14:22}
4:6
    Therefore, since it is left for some to enter into it, and the ones who were proclaimed the good-
news beforehand have not entered into it because of disobedience, 4:7 he again determines a certain
day as today, saying in David, after so-much time (just-as it has been spoken beforehand), ‘Today
if you° hear his voice, do not harden your° hearts.’ {Psa 95:7, 8} 4:8 For* if Joshua had given-rest to
them, he would have not been speaking concerning another day after these things. 4:9 Consequently*,
a Sabbath-rest is left for the people of God. 4:10 For* the one who entered into his rest, he also rested
from his works, just-like God did from his own. 4:11 Therefore, let us be diligent to enter into that
rest, in-order-that not anyone should fall into the same example of disobedience.
     4:12
           For* the word of God is living and effective and sharper beyond every two edged sword and
is penetrating till the division of both soul and spirit, of both bodily-joints and marrows and is a
judge of the contemplations and deliberations of the heart. 4:13 And there is no created thing
unapparent in his sight, but all things are naked and have been laid-bare to his eyes to whom is the


338                                                                                                  mlvbible.com
word to us.
     4:14
           Therefore, having a great high-priest, Jesus the Son of God, who has gone through the
heavens, let us hold-fast the confession. 4:15 For* we do not have a high-priest who is unable to
sympathize together-with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted according-to all things
according-to our likeness, yet without sin. 4:16 Therefore, let us come near to the throne of grace with
boldness, in-order-that we may receive mercy and may find grace *for opportune help.
                                              [Hebrews 5] TOC
    5:1
         For* every high-priest, being taken out-of men, is designated to act on behalf of men in things
pertaining to God, in-order-that he should offer both gifts and sacrifices on behalf of sins, 5:2 he who
is able to moderate his emotions with the ones who are ignorant and are misled, since he himself is
also encompassed with weakness, 5:3 and because of this weakness, just-as he is obligated to offer
sacrifices on behalf of sins concerning the people so also concerning himself. 5:4 And not anyone
takes the honor for himself, but he who is called by God, just-as also was Aaron.
     5:5
         So the Christ also did not glorify himself to become a high-priest, but he who spoke to him,
‘You are my Son; I have fathered you today.’ {Psa 2:7} 5:6 Just-as he also says in a different Scripture,
‘You are a priest forever according-to the order of Melchizedek.’ {Psa 110:4} 5:7 He who, in the days
of his flesh, offered up both supplications and prayers with a strong outcry and tears to the one being
able to save him from death and he was heard from his piety. 5:8 Although being a Son, he learned
obedience from the things which he suffered; 5:9 and having been completed, he became the cause
of everlasting salvation to all the ones who are obeying* him, 5:10 having been addressed by God, as
high-priest according-to the order of Melchizedek.
    5:11
          Concerning whom, there is much for us to say in speech (also hard to translate {i.e., simplify}),
since you° have become sluggish in the ears {i.e., refusing to hear truth; selective hearing}. 5:12 For* you° also
ought to be teachers by now because of the time, but you° again have need of one to teach you°, as
to what are the elemental principles of the beginning oracles of God. And you° have become ones
having need of milk and not of solid nourishment. 5:13 For* everyone who partakes of milk is
inexperienced of the word of righteousness, for* he is an infant. 5:14 But solid nourishment is for the
mature ones, from the ones who, through their habit, and their senses have been exercised to the
discerning of both good and evil.
                                              [Hebrews 6] TOC
    6:1
         Hence, having left the word of the beginning principles of Christ, we should carry upon {i.e.,
onto, over to}    maturity, not putting down again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of
faith upon God, 6:2 of the teaching of immersions* {i.e., O.T. ceremonial washings} and of the laying upon
of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of everlasting judgment. 6:3 And we might do* this,
if indeed* God permits*.
    6:4
         For* it is impossible, regarding the ones who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly
gift and became partakers of the Holy Spirit 6:5 and tasted the good word of God and the powers of
the future world 6:6 and then having fallen-away, to renew them again to repentance, because they are

again crucifying for themselves the Son of God and disgracing him.
    6:7
         For* the soil which drank the rainfall, while coming upon her often, and is bearing forth
vegetation fit for those because of whom it is also cultivated, receives blessing from God. 6:8 But the
soil bringing forth thorns and thistles, it is unapproved and near to a curse, whose end is *for burning.
    6:9
         But beloved, even if we speak so, we have confidence of the better things concerning you°, even
those things being held to salvation. 6:10 For* God is not unrighteous to forget your° work and the
labor of the love* which you° showed toward his name, having served the holy-ones and still serving
them. 6:11 But we are desiring each of you° to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope
till the end, 6:12 in-order-that you° should not become sluggish, but imitators of the ones inheriting
the promises through faith and patience.
    6:13
         For* after God promised to Abraham, since he was holding no one greater to swear according-
to, he had sworn according-to himself, 6:14 saying, Absolutely in blessing, I will bless you and in
multiplying, I will multiply you. {Gen 22:17} 6:15 And thus Abraham, having had patience, obtained
the promise. 6:16 For* indeed, men swear according-to the greater, and the oath made *for confirmation
is an ending in every dispute with them, 6:17 in which God, planning to show even-more to the heirs
of the promise the unchangeable will of his plan, intermediated this with an oath, 6:18 in-order-that
through two unchangeable matters, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong
encouragement, having fled for refuge to take-hold of the hope laying before us. 6:19 This hope, which
we have as an anchor of the soul, is both secure and steadfast and entering into the inner side of the
curtain, 6:20 where a forerunner, Jesus, entered on our behalf, when he became a high-priest forever
according-to the order of Melchizedek.

     7:1
         For* this Melchizedek, King of Salem, priest of the Highest God, who met with Abraham
returning from the butchering of the kings and blessed him, 7:2 to whom Abraham also divided a tenth
away from all things. Being first indeed, by translation, King of righteousness and thereafter also
King of Salem, which is King of peace; 7:3 he had no father, no mother, with no genealogy, having
neither beginning of days nor end of life, but having been made similar to the Son of God, remains
a priest continually. {Gen 14:18}
    7:4
         Now view° how-great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out-of
the spoils. 7:5 And they indeed from the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have the
commandment to take-tithes from the people according-to the law, this is, from their brethren,
although having come forth out-of the loin of Abraham. 7:6 But he who has no genealogy traced from
them has taken-tithes of Abraham and has blessed the one who has the promises. 7:7 But without any
dispute the inferior is blessed by the better one. 7:8 And men indeed receive tithes who die here, but
there, it is testified that he is living. 7:9 And, so as to speak the declaration, even Levi, who receives
tithes, has been paid-tithes through Abraham, 7:10 for* he was still in the loin of his father, when
Melchizedek met him.

‘covenant’ and ‘testament’ used by various translations have always been the same Greek word. The Old or New
Testament is exactly the same as The Old or New Covenant. Covenant was adopted throughout the MLV because it also
has a verb form. Covenant is a contract, one was God with the Jews; replaced by the one which God made with the
Christians. More is in the ‘Definitions’ section. This Old Covenant being replaced by the New Covenant was foretold
in Jer 31:31-34.}
     7:11
          Therefore, if there indeed was completion through the Levitical priesthood (for* the people had
the law instituted upon it), what need was there still for a different priest to rise* up according-to the
order of Melchizedek and not to be called* according-to the order of Aaron? 7:12 For* when the
priesthood is transferred it also out-of necessity becomes a transfer of the law. 7:13 For* he belongs
to a different tribe upon whom these things are said, from which no one has taken-heed to the altar.
7:14
     For* it is evident that our Lord has risen up out-of Judah, as to which tribe Moses spoke nothing
concerning the priesthood. 7:15 And what we say is still even-more evident, if there stands up a
different priest, according-to the likeness of Melchizedek, 7:16 who has become, not according-to the
Law of a fleshly commandment, but according-to the power of an indestructible life, 7:17 for* he
testifies, ‘You are a priest forever, according-to the order of Melchizedek.’ {Psa 110:4} 7:18 For*
indeed, it becomes a nullifying of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and
unprofitableness 7:19 (for* the law completed nothing) and a bringing* in of a better hope, through
which we are drawing near to God. 7:20 And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, for* the ones who
indeed have become priests are so without an oath, 7:21 but he, with an oath through the one saying
what is pertaining to him, ‘The Lord swore and will not regret, you are a priest forever, according-to
the order of Melchizedek.’ {Psa 110:4} 7:22 Jesus has also become the guarantee according-to a so-
much better covenant*. 7:23 And they have become indeed many priests in number, because they are
prevented by death to remain in office, 7:24 but he has his perpetual priesthood because of him, the
one who is to remain forever. 7:25 Hence he is also able to completely save the ones who come to God
through him, always living, *that* he may petition on their behalf.
     7:26
          For* such a high-priest was suitable to us, holy, guiltless, undefiled, who has been separated
away from sinners and became exalted from the heavens, 7:27 and who has no necessity every day to
offer up sacrifices just-like the high-priests (beforehand on behalf of their own sins, and thereafter
for the ones of the people), for* he did* this once for all, having offered up himself. 7:28 For* the law
designates men as high-priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which was after the
law, appoints a Son, having been completed forever.

     8:1
         Now a summation upon the things in which are spoken is this: we have such a high-priest, who
sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 8:2 a minister* of the holy of
holies and of the true* tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man. 8:3 For* every high-priest is
designated, *that* he should offer both gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this one to also
have something which he should offer. 8:4 For* if he indeed was upon the earth, he would not even
be a priest, being that the priests who offer the gifts according-to the law, 8:5 who gives-divine-
service to what is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just-as Moses had been divinely-warned
while being about to complete the tabernacle; for* behold, he says, 'You will be making* all things

according-to the pattern which was shown to you in the mountain.' {Exo 25:40} 8:6 But now he has
obtained a more-excellent ministry*, inasmuch as he is also the intermediary of a better covenant*,
which has been instituted upon better promises.
    8:7
        For* if that first covenant* was blameless, then no place would have been sought for a second.
8:8
    For* finding-fault with them, he says, ‘Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, And I will
complete a new covenant* upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, 8:9 not according-to
the covenant* which I made* with their fathers in the day when I myself grabbed their hand to lead
them forth out-of the land of Egypt, because they themselves did not remain in my covenant* and I
neglected them, says the Lord. 8:10 Because this one is the covenant* which I will covenant* with the
house of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will be giving my laws into their mind and I will be
writing them upon their hearts. And I will be a God to them and they themselves will be covenanted*
into a people for me; 8:11 and they should never need to teach, saying, Know the Lord, to each one
his fellow-citizen and each one his brother, because all will know me, from the little insofar as their
great ones. 8:12 Because I will be lenient to their unrighteousnesses; I should never remember their
lawlessnesses and their sins anymore.’ {Jer 31:31-34}
    8:13
         While* we were saying, a new covenant*, the first has become-obsolete. But the one that
becomes-obsolete and is aged is near to disappearing.

    9:1
        Therefore indeed, even the first tabernacle had ordinances of divine-service to God and the
holy-place, a worldly one. 9:2 For* the first tabernacle was prepared, which is called* the holy-place,
in which were the lamp-stand and the table and the loaves of the showbread. 9:3 But the tabernacle
which is called* the holy of holies was after the second curtain, 9:4 holding a golden altar of incense
and the ark of the covenant*, having been covered all around on every-side with gold, in which was
the golden jar holding the manna and Aaron’s scepter which had sprouted and the tablets of the
covenant*, 9:5 and up above it the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat, concerning which
things it is now not the time to speak of them individually. {Exo 25:1-40, 26:36, 40:3, Num 17:10}
    9:6
        Now these things having thus been prepared, the priests indeed go-forth always into the first
tabernacle, completing the divine-services to God; 9:7 but the high-priest went alone into the second,
once in the year for all, not without blood, which he offers on behalf of himself and on behalf of the
sins of ignorance of the people. 9:8 The Holy Spirit indicating this, that the way into the holy of holies
to have not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has a standing. 9:9 This tabernacle
(which is a figure toward the present time), according-to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered,
they are not able to complete the one giving-divine-service to God according-to the conscience, 9:10
being only ordinances of the flesh (upon the basis of foods, drinks and assorted ceremonial
washings), laying upon us till a time of reformation.
    9:11
         But Christ came* as a high-priest of the future good things, through the greater and more
complete tabernacle not made* with hands (this thing is not of this creation), 9:12 nor through the
blood of male-goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy of
holies, having found everlasting redemption. 9:13 For* if the blood of male-goats and oxen and the
ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the ones who have been desecrated, is making one holy toward the
cleanness of the flesh, 9:14 how-much more the blood of Christ (who through the everlasting Spirit


342                                                                                            mlvbible.com
offered himself unblemished to God), will be cleansing your° conscience from dead works, *that* you
may give-divine-service to the living God.
      9:15
            And because of this, he is the intermediary of a new covenant*, *that his death having
happened *for the redemption of the transgressions which were against the first covenant*, *that the
ones who have been called may receive the promise of the everlasting inheritance. 9:16 For* where
there is a covenant*, it is a necessity for the death of the one who covenanted* it to be brought about.
9:17
     For* a covenant* is steadfast upon the dead, since it is never enforced when he who covenanted*
it is living. 9:18 Hence even the first covenant* has not been inaugurated without blood. 9:19 For* when
every commandment was spoken by Moses to all the people according-to the law, and when he took
the blood of the calves and the male-goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both
the book itself and all the people, 9:20 saying, ‘This is the blood of the covenant* which God
commanded toward you°.’ {Exo 24:8} 9:21 Now likewise, he also sprinkled the tabernacle and all the
vessels of the ministry* in the blood. 9:22 And according-to the law, almost all things are cleansed in
blood and no forgiveness happens without the shedding of blood.
     9:23
           Therefore indeed, it was a necessity that the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed
with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 9:24 For* the Christ
did not enter into the holy of holies made* with hands, counterparts to the true* one, but into heaven
itself, now to be manifested in the face of God on our behalf. 9:25 Nor did he enter in-order-that he
should offer himself often, just-like the high-priest enters into the holy of holies every year with*
another’s blood; 9:26 otherwise it was essential for him to suffer often even from the conception of
the world, but now once for all upon the end of the ages, he has been manifested *for the nullifying
of sin through the sacrifice of himself. 9:27 And inasmuch as it is laying up for men to die once but
after this is the judgment, 9:28 so the Christ (having been offered once for all, *that* he should carry
the sins of many), will also be seen a second-time *for salvation, separate from sin, to the same who
are waiting for him.
                                             [Hebrews 10] TOC
     10:1
           For* the law, having a shadow of the future good things (not the same image of the matters),
they are never able to complete the ones who come near with the same continued sacrifices which
they are offering every year. 10:2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased being offered? Because the
ones giving-divine-service to God, once having been cleansed, would then have a conscience of sins
no more. 10:3 But in them, those sacrifices, there is a remembrance of sins every year. 10:4 For* it is
impossible for the blood of oxen and male-goats to take away sins. 10:5 Hence while entering into the
world, he says, ‘You did not wish for sacrifice and offering, but you, yourself, completed a body for
me. 10:6 You were not delighted with whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices concerning sin. 10:7 Then
I said (it has been written concerning me in the volume of the book), Behold, I am coming to do*
your will, God.’ {Psa 40:6-8} 10:8 After saying this above, You did not wish, nor were you delighted
in sacrifice and offering and whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices concerning sin (which are offered
according-to the law), 10:9 then he has said, ‘Behold, I am coming to do* your will, God.’ {Psa 40:6-8}
He takes away permanently {Or: assassinates} the first covenant*, in-order-that he should establish the
second covenant*, 10:10 in which will, we are being made holy through the offering of the body of
Jesus Christ, once for all. 10:11 And indeed every priest stands every day ministering* and often


mlvbible.org                                                                                          343
offering the same sacrifices, which are never able to take-away sins. {Exo 29:38} 10:12 But he himself,
having offered one continued sacrifice on behalf of sins, sat down at the right hand of God, 10:13
furthermore waiting until his enemies should be placed under the footstool of his feet. 10:14 For* he
has completed in one continued offering the ones who are made holy. 10:15 And the Holy Spirit also
testifies to us, for* after having said beforehand, 10:16 ‘This is the covenant* which I will covenant*
for them after those days, says the Lord, I will be giving my laws upon their hearts and I will write
them upon their minds.’ 10:17 And ‘I should never remember their sins and their lawlessnesses
anymore.’ {Jer 31:33-34} 10:18 Now where the forgiveness of these is, there is no more an offering
concerning sin.
    10:19
            Therefore, brethren, having boldness *for the entrance into the holy of holies by the blood of
Jesus, 10:20 a fresh and living way which he inaugurated for us through the curtain (this is, his flesh),
10:21
       and having a great priest over the house of God, 10:22 let us come near with a true* heart in full
assurance of faith, our hearts having been sprinkled away from an evil conscience and our body,
having been fully-washed in clean {Or: cleansing} water. 10:23 We should hold-onto the confession of
hope unwavering, for* he who promised is faithful. 10:24 And we should consider one another *for
motivating each other from love* and from good works, 10:25 not forsaking the gathering-together of
ourselves, just-as the custom is with some, but encouraging one another, and so-much more,
inasmuch as you° are seeing the day drawing near.
     10:26
            For* if we are willfully sinning after we received the full knowledge of the truth, then a
sacrifice is left no more for us concerning sins, 10:27 but a certain fearful expectancy of judgment and
a zeal of fire being about to eat the adversaries. 10:28 Anyone, having rejected the Law of Moses, dies
without mercies upon the word of two or three witnesses. {Deu 17:6} 10:29 How-much worse
punishment, do you° think he will be deemed worthy of for having trampled down the Son of God,
and having deemed the blood of the covenant* in which he was made holy as common, and having
insulted the Spirit of grace? 10:30 For* we know the one who said, ‘Vengeance is for me. I will be
repaying, says the Lord.’ And again, ‘The Lord will judge his people.’ {Deu 32:35-36, Psa 135:14} 10:31
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
      10:32
             But remind° yourselves of the former days, when you° were enlightened, in which you°
endured a large conflict of sufferings, 10:33 in this thing indeed, being made a spectacle both by
reproaches and afflictions, but in this thing, you° became partners of the ones conducting themselves
so. 10:34 For* you° also sympathized together-with me in my bonds, and you° accepted the ravening
of your° possessions with joy, knowing that you° have for yourselves a better possession in the
heavens and an abiding one. 10:35 Therefore, do° not cast away your° boldness, which has great reward.
10:36
       For* you° have need of endurance, in-order-that, having done* the will of God, you° may get the
promise for yourselves. 10:37 ‘For* still a little while, O how-much? O how-much? The one coming
will be coming and will not delay. 10:38 But the righteous one will be living from faith and if he
should retreat back, my soul does not delight in him.’ {Isa 26:20, Hab. 2:3-4} 10:39 But we are not from
this retreating back leading to destruction, but we are from the faith leading to the preservation of
the soul.

innumerable as the sand beside the sea shore. {Gen 18:1-33, 22:17}

received back their dead from a resurrection. But others were tortured, having not accepted their
redemption; in-order-that they might obtain a better resurrection, 11:36 and others received a trial from
mockings and scourges, but still more, from bonds and prison. 11:37 They were stoned; they were
sawed in two; they were tempted; they died in murder from the sword; they went around in
sheepskins, and in goat hides; they were lacking, being afflicted, and being mistreated 11:38 (of whom
the world was not worthy), wandering in the wildernesses and mountains and caves and the holes
of the earth. 11:39 And all these, having been testified of through the faith, {Or: witnessed to through their
faith.} did not get the promise for themselves, 11:40 God having foreseen something better concerning
us, in-order-that they should not be completed separate from us. {Jud 6:4, 11, 15, 1Sa 7:1-17, 2Sa 2:1-32,

reproved by him. 12:6 For* whom the Lord loves*, he disciplines, and scourges every son whom he is

sons. 12:9 Thereafter, we indeed had the fathers of our flesh as correctors of us, and we revered them.

indeed were disciplining us *for a few days according-to what did seem right to them, but he does
it upon what is advantageous for us, *that* we may receive of his holiness. 12:11 Now indeed all
disciplining does not seem to be a thing of joy for the present*, but of sorrow; now later it gives
peaceful fruit of righteousness to the ones who have been exercised because of it. 12:12 Hence

feet, in-order-that what is lame might not be turned aside, but rather should be healed.

exercising the oversight of yourselves lest there is anyone who comes-short, away from the grace of
God; lest any root of bitterness springing upward, should trouble you°, and many might be defiled
through this; 12:16 lest there is any fornicator or profane person, like Esau, who gave away his
birthrights in exchange-for one dinner. {Gen 25:31} 12:17 For* you° know thereafter that even wishing
to inherit the bounty, he was rejected*, for* he found no chance of repentance although having sought

           For* you° have not come to a mountain being touched and having been burned with fire and
to blackness and to darkness and to whirlwind, 12:19 and to the noise of a trumpet and to the voice of
declarations, which voice the ones who heard renounced, asking the word not to be added to them.

will be stoned.’ {Exo 19:12-13, 16, Deu 4:11} 12:21 And so fearful was the manifestation, that Moses said,
‘I am fearful and trembling. {Deu 9:19} 12:22 But you° have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the

of Abel. 12:25 Beware° that you° do not renounce the one speaking. For* if those men did not flee {Or:
escape}, having renounced the one who divinely-warned them upon the earth, much more we may not
escape the ones turning away from the one who is from the heavens, 12:26 whose voice then shook the
earth. But now he has promised, saying, ‘Still once for all, I do not only shake the earth, but also the
heaven.’ {Hag. 2:6} 12:27 And the saying, ‘still once for all,’ indicates the transfer of the things which
are shaken, as of things which have been made*, in-order-that the things which are not shaken may

    {Note: Mark and Matthew were written at about the same time as James. This ties up a lot of questions why Matthew
is written to the Jews and Mark was written to the Greeks.}
                                            {{ Introduction to James 50-52 AD
    This letter was most likely written about the same time the letter in Acts 15 was sent to all the congregations from the
apostles in Jerusalem. That letter told the Gentile Christians and the Jewish Christians that only four things from the Law
(Old Testament) were to be obeyed. Jews who had known the Law all of their lives could not keep it, no way Gentiles
could either and neither has to obey it under the New Testament.
    So James is fast paced written to an overall Christian audience and encourages all to not have a ‘faith only,’ or a
‘works can save you’ type attitude but to have both. James has more commandments (short and simple) per page than
does any other letter: Do not be a hearer only but be a doer. To believe (have faith) is to have works. Do not blame God
for your lack of control. Listen. Practice mercy. Do not be prejudiced. Do not ignore the poor, etc. The classic ‘faith only’
can never save you rebuke because even ‘demons believe’ is in 2:19. James tells us how to live as Christians. He tells
us ‘like it is.’}}

     1:1
          James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes, the ones who
are in the dispersion. Hail to you°!
     1:2
         My brethren, deem° it with all joy, whenever you° fall into various temptations, 1:3 knowing that
the proving of your° faith {Or: belief; and throughout the N.T.} is working out endurance. 1:4 But let
endurance have its completed work, in-order-that you° may be completed and whole, deficient in
nothing.
     1:5
         But if anyone of you° is deficient of wisdom, let him ask from God, who gives to all liberally
and does not reproach any, and it will be given to him. 1:6 But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing
in himself. For* he who is doubting himself has resembled a wave of the sea being blown by the wind
and tossed around. 1:7 For* do not let that man assume that he will be receiving anything from the
Lord; 1:8 an indecisive man is restless in all his ways.
     1:9
          But let the humble brother boast in his elevation, 1:10 but the rich brother in his humbleness,
because like the flower of the grass, he will pass-away. 1:11 For* the sun rose together-with the
burning heat, and dried up the grass, and its flower fell off and the beauty of its face perished. So will
the rich man also fade-away in his pursuits.
     1:12
           The fortunate man who is enduring temptation, because, when he became approved, he will
be receiving the crown of life, which the Lord promised to the ones who love* him. 1:13 Let no one
say while he is tempted, I am tempted from God, for* God is not temptable from evils, and he himself
tempts no one. 1:14 But each person is tempted, while he is lured out and is enticed by his own lust.
1:15
     Thereafter after the lust has conceived, it bears sin, and sin, having been matured, gives-birth to
death. 1:16 Do° not be misled, my beloved brethren!
     1:17
           Every good act of giving, and every complete gift, is from above, descending from the Father
of lights, with whom there is no change or a shadow of turning. 1:18 Having willed it, he gave-birth
to us with the word of truth, *that* we might be a certain first-fruit of his created things.

     1:19
          So-then my beloved brethren, let every man be quick *that* he may hear, be slow *that* he may
speak, and slow to wrath. 1:20 For* the wrath of man is not working out the righteousness of God. 1:21
Hence, placing away from yourselves all filthiness and the abundance of malice, accept° the
implanted word in meekness, which is able to save your° souls.
     1:22
           But become° doers of the word and not hearers only, deluding yourselves. 1:23 Because if
anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this one has resembled a man considering his face
(which was his from birth) in a mirror. 1:24 For* he considered himself, and has gone away and
immediately forgot what sort of man he was. 1:25 But he who has peered into the completed law, the
law of freedom, and has remained in it, this one, having not become a forgetful hearer, but a doer
of work, this one will be fortunate in his doing* {Or: action; practice}. {1Co 13:10}
     1:26
          If anyone among you° thinks himself to be outwardly religious, though he does not bridle his
tongue but deceiving his heart; this one’s religion is futile.
     {Many try to use the other meaning of this Greek word: ‘oversee’ for ‘visit’. The ‘orphans’ can be the ‘fatherless’.
See the section ‘Greek History During New Testament Times.’}
    1:27
         A clean and undefiled religion with our God and Father is this: to visit the orphans and widows
in their affliction, and to keep himself unstained from the world.

         My brethren, do° not have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, in favoritisms.
2:2
    For* if a man should enter into your° congregation with a gold ring, in bright apparel and if a poor
person in filthy apparel also should enter, 2:3 you° might look upon the one who is wearing the bright
apparel and might say to him, You, sit here in the good seat; and you° might say to the poor person,
You, stand there or sit here under my footstool. 2:4 And have you° not made distinction among
yourselves and then became judges from evil reasonings?
     2:5
         Listen°, my beloved brethren. Did God not choose the poor of the world to be rich in faith and
heirs of the kingdom which he promised to the ones who love* him? 2:6 But you° dishonored the poor.
Are the rich not oppressing you°? And are they themselves not dragging you° into the courts? 2:7 Are
they themselves not blaspheming the good name, the name which was surnamed upon you°? {Act
11:26} 2:8 Nevertheless, if you° complete the royal law according-to the Scripture, ‘You will love* your
neighbor like yourself,’ you° are doing* well. {Lev 19:18} 2:9 But if you° are showing-favoritism, you°
are working sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
     2:10
          For* whoever will be keeping the whole law and but yet will trip in one point, he has become
liable to all of it. 2:11 For* he who said, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not murder.’ {Exo
20:13-14, Deu 5:17-18} But if you will not commit adultery, but yet you will commit murder, you have
become a transgressor of the law. 2:12 Speak° so and practice° so, as one being about to be judged
through the law of freedom. 2:13 For* the judgment is merciless to the one having not practiced mercy;
mercy wins over judgment.
     2:14
          My brethren, what is the profit, if someone says he has faith, but does not have works? Is the
faith, he has, able to save him? 2:15 But if a brother or sister is* naked and may be deficient of daily
nourishment, 2:16 and anyone out-of you° may say to them, Proceed° away in peace. Be° warmed and
be° fully-fed, but do° not give to them the body’s requirements, what is the profit? 2:17 So also your
faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself.

    2:18
         But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith away from your
works. I will also show you my faith from my works. 2:19 You believe that God is one; you are doing*
well. The demons also believe and they are shuddering. 2:20 But O vain man, are you willing to know
that faith is dead without works?
    2:21
         Was not Abraham our father made righteous from works, having offered up Isaac his son upon
the altar? 2:22 Do you see that faith was working together-with his works and his faith was completed
from his works? 2:23 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, ‘And Abraham believed God and
it was counted to him *for righteousness,’ and he was called the friend of God. {Gen 15:6} 2:24 Now-
then, are you° seeing that a man is made righteous from works and not from faith only?
   2:25
        Now likewise, was not Rahab the prostitute also made righteous from works, after she accepted
the messengers and put them forth a different way? {Jos 2:1, 6:17, 23} 2:26 For* just-like the body
without a spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.

    3:1
         My brethren, do° not let many of you° become teachers, knowing that we will be receiving a
greater judgment. 3:2 For* we all trip in many things. If anyone does not trip in speech, this one is a
mature man, is also able to bridle the whole body. 3:3 Behold we put the bridles into the mouths of
the horses *that* they should be obedient to us, and we direct their whole body. 3:4 Behold also the
ships, though being so-great and are driven by harsh winds, yet are directed by a little rudder,
wherever the impulse of the steersman is planning.
    3:5
         So the tongue is also a little member and boasts of magnificent things. Behold, how-vast a
forest it lights up with such a small fire! 3:6 And the tongue is a fire, the world of unrighteousness.
Thus the tongue is designated among our members as what stains the whole body and is igniting the
birth cycle {i.e., the cycle of life} and is being ignited by hell. 3:7 For* every nature of beasts and birds,
of reptiles and sea-creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by human nature. 3:8 But no one from
mankind is able to tame the tongue; it is an uncontrollable evil, full of deadly poison. 3:9 We are
giving-thanks to God and the Father with* it and we are cursing men with* it, the ones who have
become according-to the likeness of God. 3:10 A thanks and a curse comes forth out-of the same
mouth. My brethren, these things do not need to become so! 3:11 The spring is not gushing sweet and
bitter water from the same hole in the ground, is it? 3:12 My brethren, a fig tree is not able to produce
olives or a vine produce figs, are they? Thus no spring is able to produce both salty and sweet water.
    3:13
         Who is wise and knowledgeable among you°? Let him show out-of the good conduct, he has,
his works in meekness of wisdom. 3:14 But if you° have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your°
heart, do° not boast and lie° against the truth. 3:15 This wisdom is not coming down from above, but
is earthly, physical, demonic. 3:16 For* where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is unrest and
every evil matter. 3:17 But the wisdom which is from above is indeed first pure, thereafter is peaceful,
gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and non-pretended. 3:18 And the fruit of
righteousness is sown in peace by the ones making* peace.

long to envy? 4:6 But he is giving greater grace. Hence the Scripture says, ‘God resists the haughty,
but gives grace to the humble.’ {Prov 3:34}

law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge. 4:12 There is the one lawgiver, who is able to save and
to destroy; but who are you who judges the other?

time but also thereafter disappears. 4:15 Instead of the thing spoken, you° ought to say, If the Lord
wills, and we should also live, then we might do* this or that. 4:16 But now you° boast in your° self-
importances. All such boasting is evil. 4:17 Therefore, knowing to do* good and not doing* it, to him,

Many times, it is back and forth, commands ‘do this’ and ‘don’t do this’ or ‘be this’ and ‘do not be this.’ This is a letter
of hope in the midst of suffering persecution from the Jews, and the Roman government under Nero and the intended

braiding the hairs, and of placing on of gold things or of clothing of expensive garments, 3:4 but let
it be the hidden human things of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a meek and quiet spirit,

    The emphasis is on false teachers and false teaching. It is a letter of warning, and Peter’s cure for false teaching is true*
spiritual knowledge. As Jesus showed us in Mat, it has been written... This letter is most likely a follow-up letter to his
previous one to the same group of people.
    It was written in Peter’s mature years. He is one of the elders. It stirs up readers to grow in Christian character and
encourage them into a patient expectation of the Lord’s return also warning them against being ‘led away in the error
of the immoral.’ As translators, do not be lead away by those Bibles who would change Chapter 3:10 at the end to
anything but ‘will be burned up.’ Peter wants them to grow in ‘the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ.’}}

          Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to the ones who were allotted an
equally precious faith with us, in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ: 1:2 may grace
and peace be multiplied to you° in the full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
      1:3
          As his divine* power has been bestowed to us as a gift (all things pertaining to life and
devoutness), through the full knowledge of the one who called us through glory and virtue, 1:4
through which it has been bestowed to us as a gift, the precious and greatest promises, in-order-that
through these things you° might become partners of the divine* nature, having fled away from the
corruption in the world among its lust.
     1:5
          Now also for this same thing, besides having brought in all diligence, supply° in your° faith,
virtue; and in the virtue, knowledge; 1:6 and in the knowledge, self-control; and in the self-control,
endurance; and in the endurance, devoutness; 1:7 and in the devoutness, brotherly-love; and in the
brotherly-love, love*. 1:8 For* if these things are existing and increasing in you°, none will designate
you° idle nor unfruitful toward the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1:9 For* the one is blind
in whom these things are not present*, being short-sighted, having taken on himself the forgetfulness
of {i.e., deliberately forgot} the cleansing from his old sins.
     1:10
          Hence brethren, be° more diligent to make* your° calling and choice steadfast, for* you° should
never trip someday while practicing these things, 1:11 for* so the entrance into the everlasting kingdom
of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied to you°.
     1:12
          Hence, I will habitually not be neglecting to remind you° concerning these things, although
you° are knowing them and having been established in the present* truth. 1:13 But I am deeming it
righteous, inasmuch as I am in this tabernacle, to awaken you° with a reminder, 1:14 knowing that the
removal of my tabernacle is coming quickly, just-as our Lord Jesus Christ also indicated to me. 1:15
But I will also be diligent each-time, to have you° in remembrance of these things, to practice them
after my exodus. 1:16 For* we have not followed wisely devised fables when we made known to you°
the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we became eyewitnesses of that majesty. 1:17
For* he received honor and glory from God the Father, when such a voice was carried to him by the
Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am delighted. {Mat 3:17, 17:5, Mar 1:11, Luk 3:22}
1:18
      And we heard this voice, which was carried from heaven, being together-with him in the holy
mountain. 1:19 And we have the steadfast prophetic word, as to a lamp appearing in a dreary place,
until the day should dawn and the {F} morning-star might rise, to which you° are doing* well, and
taking-heed in your° hearts. 1:20 Knowing this first, that every prophecy of Scripture does not come*

         But false* prophets happened to be also among the people, as false* teachers will also be among
you°, who will be smuggling in sects of destruction, denying even the Master who bought them,

because of whom the way of the truth will be blasphemed. 2:3 And they will be merchants of you° in
their greed with fabricated words, to whom the condemnation from long-ago is not idle, and their
destruction will not be slumbering.
     2:4
         For* if God did not spare messengers who sinned, but threw them into Tartarus {i.e., hell} and
gave them up to restraints of blackness, being kept *for judgment; 2:5 and he did not spare the ancient
world, but guarded Noah, the eighth person spared, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought*
a flood upon the world of ungodly people; {Gen 7:23, 8:1-22} 2:6 and he condemned the cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah, with a catastrophe, having incinerated them, having placed them as an example for
the ones who are about to be ungodly; {Gen 19:1-38} 2:7 and he rescued righteous Lot, who was being
subjugated by the conduct of the immoral in their unbridled-lust 2:8 (for* that righteous man, who was
dwelling among them, was tormenting his righteous soul by seeing and in hearing their lawless
works day from day {i.e., daily.}).

(being punished) toward a day of judgment, 2:10 and especially the ones conducting-themselves after
the flesh in the lust of defilement and while despising lordship. They are self-willed daring ones who
are not trembling when blaspheming heavenly glories, 2:11 whereas messengers (though being greater
in strength and power), do not bring a blasphemous judgment against them beside the Lord. 2:12 But
these unrighteous men are like natural unreasoning creatures, having been born *for apprehension
and corruption, blaspheming in things which they are ignorant of, and they will be utterly corrupted
in their corruption. 2:13 They will be getting the wages of unrighteousness, those who are deeming
the carousing in the day to be a sensual-delight. They are stains and blemishes, carousing in their
own various deceptions, while feasting sumptuously alongside you°, 2:14 having eyes full of an
adulteress and an unceasing sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart which has been exercised
from greed, having children of the curse, 2:15 having left the straight way. They were misled, having
followed in the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved* the wages of unrighteousness; {Num 22:5}
2:16
     but he had his reproof from his own violation of the law: a voiceless burro, having spoken in a
human voice, forbade the insanity of the prophet.
     2:17
          These people are waterless springs, clouds being driven by a gale to whom the blackness of
darkness has been kept forever. 2:18 For* while speaking flattering-words of futility, they entice (with*
the lusts of the flesh to unbridled-lusts) the ones who really had fled away from the ones who
conduct themselves in error. 2:19 While promising them freedom, they themselves are* bondservants
of corruption. For* in what anyone has been overpowered, in this, he has also been enslaved. 2:20 For*
if, having fled away from the defilements of the world in the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ, and yet having been again entangled, they are overpowered in these things, the last
things has become worse to them than the first. 2:21 For* it was better for them to have not fully

to them after having fully known it. 2:22 But it has befallen to them as the way of the true* proverb,

        Beloved, I am already writing this second letter to you°, in which I am awakening your° sincere
mind in a reminder, 3:2 to be reminded of the declarations which have been spoken beforehand by the
holy prophets, and the commandment of your° apostles of the Lord and Savior.
    3:3
        Knowing this first, that mockers will be coming in the last of the days, conducting-themselves
according-to their own lusts, 3:4 and saying, Where is the promise of his presence? (For* from which
time the fathers fell-asleep, all things remain thus as they were from the beginning of the creation.)
   3:5
        For* this is eluding them (willing it to be so): that the heavens were from long-ago, and an earth
established {Or: standing together} out-of water and through water by the word of God; 3:6 through
which water, the world that was then was destroyed, having been flooded in water. {Gen 7:21} 3:7 But
the current heavens and the current earth are being stored up for fire by the same word, being kept
to the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
    3:8
         But beloved, let this one thing not elude you°, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand
years, and a thousand years like one day. 3:9 The Lord is not slow concerning the promise he made,
as some deem slowness, but has patience toward us, not planning for any to perish, but for all to
make room in your° hearts *for repentance.
   3:10
         But the day of the Lord will be coming like a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass-
away with a crashing-sound, and the elements will be dissolved, being burnt with heat, and the earth
and the works which are in it will be burned up. 3:11 Therefore, with all these things being dissolved,
see what sort of things it is essential for you° to possess in all holy conducts and devotions, 3:12
expecting and diligently wanting the presence of the day of God, through which the heavens will be
dissolved, being on fire, and the elements are melted, being burnt with heat. 3:13 But according-to his
promise, we are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.
    3:14
         Hence, beloved, while expecting these things, be° diligent to be found in peace, unstained and
unblemished by him. 3:15 And deem° the patience of our Lord to be salvation, just-as our beloved
brother Paul also wrote to you° according-to the wisdom which was given to him, 3:16 as also in all
his letters, speaking in them concerning these things, in which some things are hard to perceive,
which the unlearned and unstable ones are twisting, as they also twist the rest of the Scriptures to
their own destruction. 3:17 Therefore, beloved, knowing beforehand these things, guard° yourselves,
in-order-that you° might not fall, each one from his own firmness, having been led away together-
with the error of the immoral. 3:18 But grow° in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. Glory is to him, both now and toward the final day of this world. Amen.

in no uncertain terms! With the rising interest in a merging of Christianity with the higher forms of paganism, there was
a pressing need for the presentation of adequate Christian knowledge to combat the danger. Nowhere else in the New
Testament is the combination of faith, love, and obedience so clearly brought out. The letter was written to a group of
people, with whom the author was personally acquainted and who were threatened with the same infiltration of false
teachings. The writing is from Ephesus. Major themes in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd John are the assurance of salvation. One of
John’s main purposes in 1 John is to give believers assurance (1 John 5:13), and the need for assurance is needed by all
Christians, especially true* for new converts. The Bible rejects the false teaching of ‘ once saved always saved,’ but it
does not reject the biblical doctrine of assurance.}}

written.}
   {All of John’s letters 1, 2, and 3 were written close together, 63-70 AD. God sealed up the New Testament with the
writing of Revelation, and fulfilled all the New Testament and Old Testament prophecies with the destruction of
Jerusalem. If any letters had been written after the destruction of Jerusalem, we see no reason for some of the wording
contained in them and no mention of God’s Judgment Day on the Jewish religion.}

saw and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life 1:2 and the life was manifested and we have
seen and are testifying and reporting to you° the everlasting life, which was with the Father and was
manifested to us. 1:3 What we have seen and have heard, we report to you°, in-order-that you° may
also have fellowship with us, but also our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus
Christ, 1:4 and we are writing these things to you° in-order-that our joy may be fulfilled.
    1:5
        And this is the message which we have heard from him and are reporting to you°, that God is
light and there is no darkness in him: none at all. 1:6 If we should say that we have fellowship with
him and then should walk in the darkness, we are lying to ourselves, and we are not practicing the
truth. 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another
and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son is cleansing us from every sin. 1:8 If we should say that we have
no sin, we are misleading ourselves and the truth is not in us. 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful
and righteous {F} to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1:10 If we should
say that we have not sinned, we make* him a liar and his word is not in us.

          Brethren, I write no new commandment to you°, but an old commandment which you° were
holding onto from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you° had heard from the
beginning. 2:8 Once again, I am writing a new commandment to you°, what is true* in him and in you°,
because the darkness is passing-away and the true* light is appearing already. 2:9 He who says he is
in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until now. 2:10 He who loves* his brother abides

walking around in the darkness and did not know where he is proceeding-away to because the
darkness blinded his eyes.

writing to you°, children, because you° have known the Father. 2:14 I wrote to you°, fathers, because
you° have known the one who is from the beginning. I wrote to you°, young-men, because you° are
strong and the word of God is abiding in you° and you° overcame the evil one.
     2:15
          Do° not love* the world, nor the things which are in the world. If anyone loves* the world, the
love of the Father is not in him. 2:16 Because everything in the world: the lust of the flesh and the lust
       *
of the eyes and the self-importance of life, are not from the Father, but are from the world. 2:17 And
the world is passing-away and its lust, but he who is practicing the will of God abides forever.
     2:18
          Children, it is the last hour and just-as you° have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now
many antichrists have become known; hence we know that it is the last hour. 2:19 They went forth
away from us, but they were not from us, for* if they were from us, they would have remained with
us, but they went forth, in-order-that they might be made manifest that all of them are not from us.
2:20
     And you° have an anointing from the Holy One and you° know all things. 2:21 I did not write to
you° because you° do not know the truth, but because you° know it and because every lie is not from
the truth. 2:22 Who is the liar, if not the one who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? This is the
antichrist, he who is denying the Father and the Son. 2:23 Everyone who is denying the Son, he does
not have the Father. 2:24 Therefore, let what you° have heard from the beginning abide in you°. If what
you° have heard from the beginning abides in you°, you° will also be abiding in the Son and in the
Father. 2:25 And this is the promise which he himself promised to us: everlasting life. 2:26 I wrote to
you° these things concerning the ones who are misleading you°. 2:27 And as for you°, the anointing
which you° received from him abides in you° and you° have no need that* anyone should teach you°,
but as the same anointing teaches you° concerning all things and is true* and is not a lie and just-as
it taught you°, you° will be abiding in him. 2:28 And now, abide° in him, my little-children, in-order-
that we should have boldness whenever he should be manifested, and we should not be shamed away
from him in his presence. 2:29 If you° know that he is righteous, you° also know that everyone who
is practicing righteousness has been born from him.

         Behold° what sort of love* the Father has given to us, in-order-that we might be called children
of God. Because of this, the world does not know you°, because it did not know him. 3:2 Beloved, we
are now the children of God and it was not yet manifested what we will be. But we know that, if he
is manifested, we will be similar to him, because we will be seeing him just-as he is. 3:3 And
everyone who has this hope set upon him is purifying himself, just-as that man is pure. 3:4 Everyone
who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. 3:5 And you° know that that man
was manifested in-order-that he might take away our sins, and in him is no sin. {Isa 53:4} 3:6 Everyone
who abides in him is not sinning. Everyone who is sinning has not seen him, nor has known him. 3:7
Let no one mislead you°, my little-children. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just-as that
man is righteous. 3:8 He who is practicing sin is from the devil, because the devil sins from the
beginning; to this end the Son of God was manifested, in-order-that he might tear-down the works
of the devil. 3:9 Everyone who has been born from God does not practice sin, because his seed abides
in him and he is not able to practice sin, because he has been born from God. 3:10 The children of God
and the children of the devil are apparent in this: everyone who does not practice righteousness is
not from God and he who does not love* his brother. 3:11 Because this is the message which you° have
heard from the beginning, in-order-that we should love* one another, 3:12 not like Cain who was from

works were evil but the works of his brother were righteous. {Gen 4:8}

everlasting life abiding in himself. 3:16 We have known love* in this, because that man laid down his
life on our behalf and we ought to lay down the lives we have on behalf of the brethren. 3:17 But
whoever has the livelihood of the world and should view his brother having need and then should
lock up his heart* from him, how does the love* of God abide in him? 3:18 My little-children, do not
love* in word, nor with the tongue, but in work and in truth. 3:19 And we know in this that we are
from the truth and will persuade our hearts before him, 3:20 because if our heart condemns us, God
is greater than our heart and he knows all things. 3:21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we
have boldness toward God; 3:22 and whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we are keeping
his commandments and are practicing the things which are pleasing in his sight. 3:23 And this is his
commandment, in-order-that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and should love*
one another, just-as he gave commandment to us. 3:24 And he who is keeping his commandments
abides in him and he in him. And we know in this that he abides in us, from the Spirit whom he gave

God and God abides in him. 4:17 In this, love* has been completed with us, in-order-that we may have
boldness in the day of judgment, because just-as that man is complete, we are also complete in this
world. 4:18 There is no fear in love*, but mature love* casts the fear outward, because the fear has
punishment, and he who fears has not been matured in love*. 4:19 We love* him because he loved* us
first. 4:20 If anyone says, I love* God and then should hate his brother, he is a liar; for* he who does
not love* his brother, whom he has seen, how is he able to love* God, whom he has not seen? 4:21 And

          Woe to them! Because they traveled in the way of Cain and poured themselves into the error

                                           {{ Introduction to Revelation 64-66 AD.
    The book of Revelation was written before 66 AD, the start of the invasion by Vespasian and his son Titus toward
Jerusalem. If it had been written after the destruction of Jerusalem, that would have been mentioned in the book since
that was God’s Judgment Day upon the Jews and a great example about what happens to false teachers or religious
groups who claim to be ‘God’s people’.
    The book was written during the time when Christians were not only being persecuted by the Jews but also from the
Roman government by one of the vilest men to walk on this earth, Caesar Nero. The entire book is written in extremely
symbolic language, and O.T. like arrangement (not chronological). This was like a code that the Christians would
understand, but the Jews and Romans would never see God’s judgment on the Jewish nation coming. This would keep
them safe and give them hope during this extreme time of Nero (the man 666) and while seeing the deadly advance of
Roman armies (Luk 21:20) reserved to put an end to the various Jewish rebellions which had plagued Roman rule for
over a decade, once and for all.
    Through the symbolic language, you have a historical ‘play by play’ of what is going to take place with the eventual
fall of Jerusalem, which took 3.5 years. It even prophesies of the stopping of the advance also foretold in Luke 21, so
no single Christian lost their life in the 3.5-year massacre (Josephus) and the final destruction of the Jewish temple and
all its records, thus fulfilling every unfulfilled prophecy of the Old and New Testament. The armies were led by the soon
to be Caesar Vespasian and then his son Titus after apostle Paul’s execution by Nero and then Nero’s death in June 68
AD. Even though Revelation is a symbolically written history book from 1 to 20:11, it still gives every Christian hope
because we know that God always wins!
    Revelation contains the chapter (20:1-7) most often mistranslated to meet certain beliefs more than any other place
in the Bible (the ‘abolish’ in Mat 5:17 is second). If you have to change what the Word of God says to promote your
doctrine, then your doctrine cannot possibly be God’s doctrine. The final warning from God, ‘do not add to or take away
from’ God’s word in 22:19. People who ‘add’ or ‘remove’ things in worship or the Word of God as it is preached, should
take-heed and know they are taking a chance with their souls and need to repent.}}

which are essential to happen shortly and he signified it, having sent it through his messenger to his

and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ. 1:10 I became in the spirit on the Lord’s day and I heard
behind me a loud voice, like that of a trumpet 1:11 saying, What you see, write in a book and send it
to the seven congregations*: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamus and to Thyatira and to Sardis
and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. 1:12 And I turned there to see the voice which was speaking with
me and having turned, I saw seven golden lamp-stands. 1:13 And one similar to a son of man was in
the middle of the seven lamp-stands, having clothed himself with a long-robe and the breasts have
been girded around with a golden belt. 1:14 Now his head and the hairs of it were white like white
wool, like snow, and his eyes were like a flame of fire; 1:15 and his feet similar to polished brass, like
things having been refined in a furnace, and his voice like the voice of many waters. 1:16 And he has
in his right hand seven stars and a sharp two edged long-sword travels out from his mouth and his
appearance is as the sun appears in its power. 1:17 And when I saw him, I fell like one dead toward
his feet. And he placed his right hand upon me, saying, Do not fear; I am the first and the last, 1:18 and
the Living One, and I became dead and behold, I am living forevermore and I have the keys of death
and of Hades. Amen. 1:19 Therefore, write the things which you saw, and the things which are, and
the things which are about to happen after these things. 1:20 The mystery of the seven stars which you
saw in my right hand and the seven golden lamp-stands is this: the seven stars are the messengers
of the seven congregations* and the seven lamp-stands are seven congregations*.

seven golden lamp-stands says these things: 2:2 I know your works and your labor and endurance and
that you are not able to bear evil ones and you tested the ones saying that they themselves to be
apostles, and they are not and you found them to be false* witnesses; 2:3 and you have endurance and
did bear because of my name and did not fatigue. 2:4 But I have this against you; that you left your
first love*. 2:5 Therefore, remember from where you have fallen, and repent and practice the first
works; otherwise if you do not repent, I am coming to you shortly and will move your lamp-stand
out-of its place. 2:6 But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

    The first and the last, who became dead and lived again says these things: 2:9 I know your works,
the affliction and the poverty you have (but you are rich) and the blasphemy from the ones saying
that they themselves to be Jews and they are not, but are a synagogue of the Adversary. 2:10 Do not

you dwell, where the Adversary’s throne is, and you are holding-fast my name and did not deny my
faith in the days, in which my witness, the faithful Antipas was killed beside you°, where the
Adversary is dwelling. 2:14 But I have a few things against you, because you have there some holding-
fast the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast an offense in the sight the sons of Israel, even
to eat idol-sacrifices and to fornicate. {Num 25:1-3, 31:16} 2:15 So you also likewise have some holding-

works are more-than the first ones. 2:20 But I have this against you, that you are allowing your woman
{Or: wife} Jezebel, she who calls* herself the prophetess, and is teaching and misleading my
bondservants to fornicate and to eat idol-sacrifices. 2:21 And I gave some time to her, in-order-that
she might repent, and she is not willing to repent from her fornication. 2:22 Behold, I cast her onto a
bed and the ones committing adultery with her into great affliction, if they do not repent from her
works. 2:23 And I will be killing her children with* death, and all the congregations* will know that
I am the one searching the kidneys {i.e., thoughts; see heart*} and hearts and I will be giving to you°, each
one according-to your° works. 2:24 But I am saying to you° and to the rest, the ones in Thyatira, as
many as are not holding to this teaching, who did not know the deep things of the Adversary, as they

fulfilled in the sight of my God. 3:3 Therefore, remember how you have received and heard, and keep

power and kept my word and did not deny my name. 3:9 Behold, I give those from the synagogue of

the mountains; 6:16 and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall° upon us and hide° us from
the face of the one who is sitting upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, 6:17 because the
great day of his wrath came, and who is able to stand?

fast the four winds of the earth in-order-that no wind may blow upon the earth nor upon the sea nor
upon any tree. 7:2 And I saw another messenger ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal

of the living God. And he cried out with a loud voice to the four messengers to whom it was given
to them to hurt the earth and the sea, 7:3 saying, Do° not hurt the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till
we might seal the bondservants of our God upon their foreheads.
    7:4
        And I heard the number of the ones having been sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand,
having been sealed out-of every tribe of the sons of Israel: 7:5 twelve thousand out-of the tribe of
Judah having been sealed; twelve thousand out-of the tribe of Reuben; twelve thousand out-of the
tribe of Gad; 7:6 twelve thousand out-of the tribe of Asher; twelve thousand out-of the tribe of
Naphtali; twelve thousand out-of the tribe of Manasseh; 7:7 twelve thousand out-of the tribe of
Simeon; twelve thousand out-of the tribe of Levi; twelve thousand out-of the tribe of Issachar; 7:8
twelve thousand out-of the tribe of Zebulun; twelve thousand out-of the tribe of Joseph; twelve
thousand out-of the tribe of Benjamin having been sealed.
    7:9
        I saw and behold, after these things a large crowd, which no one was able to number, out-of
every nation and tribes and peoples and languages, standing in the sight of the throne and in the sight
of the Lamb, having been dressed in white robes and palm-trees in their hands; 7:10 and they are
crying with a loud voice, saying, The salvation is in our God who is sitting upon the throne and in
the Lamb.
    7:11
         And all the messengers and the elders and the four living creatures stood in a circle of the
throne, and they fell upon their faces in the sight of the throne and worshiped God, 7:12 saying,
Assuredly, the thanks and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the
power and the strength is to our God, forevermore. Amen.
    7:13
         And one out-of the elders answered, saying to me, These, the ones having been dressed in
white robes, who are they and from where did they come?
    7:14
         And I said to him, My lord, you know.
    And he said to me, These are the ones coming out-of the great affliction and they have rinsed their
robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 7:15 Because of this, they are in the sight of the
throne of God, and they give-divine-service to him day and night in his temple and he who sits upon
the throne will be residing over them. 7:16 They will not be hungry anymore, nor thirsty anymore; nor
the heat of the sun should never fall upon them, nor every heat of the day, 7:17 because the Lamb, the
one who is up in the midst of the throne, is shepherding them and is guiding them over to the springs
of waters of life and God will be wiping-away every tear from their eyes.

    And I saw the seven messengers who are standing in God’s sight, and seven trumpets were given
to them.
    8:3
        And another messenger came and then stood over the altar, having a golden censer, and many
incenses were given to him in-order-that he should give it with the prayers of all the holy-ones upon
the golden altar which is in the sight of the throne. 8:4 And the smoke of the incenses, with the prayers
of the holy-ones, went-up in God’s sight out-of the messenger’s hand. 8:5 And the messenger has
taken the censer, and he filled it from the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth, and thunders and
voices and lightnings and an earthquake happened.

         And the seven messengers who have the seven trumpets prepared themselves in-order-that they
might sound them.

         And the first messenger sounded and it happened that hail and fire, having been mixed in
blood, and it was cast to the earth and the third of the earth was burnt up and the third of the trees
was burnt up and all the pale-green grass was burnt up.
    8:8
         And the second messenger sounded and something like a great burning mountain was cast into
the sea and the third of the sea became blood; 8:9 and the third of the created things (the ones having
lives), died which were in the sea, and the third of the ships were decayed.
    8:10
          And the third messenger sounded and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch and
it fell upon the third of the rivers and upon the springs of the waters; 8:11 and the name of the star is
called* the wormwood and the third of the waters became into wormwood, and many men died from
the waters, because they were made bitter.
    8:12
          And the fourth messenger sounded and the third of the sun was pounded flat and the third of
the moon and the third of the stars; in-order-that the third of them should be darkened and the day
might not appear for the third of it and the night likewise.
    8:13
          And I saw and I heard one eagle, flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe,
woe, to the ones dwelling upon the earth, from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three
messengers, who are about to sound.

    9:1
         And the fifth messenger sounded and I saw a star from heaven has fallen to the earth and the
key of the pit of the abyss was given to him. 9:2 And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went-
up out-of the pit, like the smoke of a burning furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened from
the smoke of the pit. 9:3 And locusts came forth out-of the smoke onto the earth, and authority was
given to them like the scorpions of the earth have authority. 9:4 And it was said to them in-order-that
they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any pale-green thing, nor any tree, except only the
men who do not have the seal of God upon their foreheads. 9:5 And it was given to them in-order-that
they should not kill them, but in-order-that they should be tormented five months, and their torment
was like the torment of a scorpion, whenever it strikes a man. 9:6 And men will seek death in those
days and they will never be finding it, and they will desire to die and death will be fleeing from them.
9:7
    And the likenesses of the locusts were similar to horses having been prepared *for war, and upon
their heads were something like golden crowns and their faces are like men’s faces. 9:8 And they had
hairs like the hairs of women and their teeth were like those of lions. 9:9 And they had breastplates,
like iron breastplates, and the voice of their wings is like the voice of chariots, of many horses
running to war. 9:10 And they have tails similar to scorpions and stings, and they have their authority
in their tails to hurt the men for five months. 9:11 They themselves have the messenger of the abyss
as king over them. His name in Hebrew is Abbadon, but in the Greek language he has the name
Apollyon.

         The first woe has gone away; behold, two woes are still coming after these things.
    9:13
         And the sixth messenger sounded and I heard one voice out-of the four horns of the golden
altar (the one in God’s sight) 9:14 saying to the sixth messenger who has the trumpet, Loose the four
messengers which have been bound upon the great river Euphrates. 9:15 And the four messengers
were loosed, who have been prepared *for the hour and the day and month and year, in-order-that
they should kill the third of men. 9:16 And the number of the armies of the horsemen are tens of
thousands of tens of thousands {i.e., an infinite number to the Greeks}. I heard the number of them. 9:17 And
so I saw the horses in the vision and the ones sitting upon them, having fiery breastplates of hyacinth
and of brimstone, and the heads of the horses like the heads of lions; and fire and smoke and
brimstone is traveling out-of their mouths. 9:18 From these three wounds, the third of men were killed
from the fire and the smoke and the brimstone, which travels out-of their mouths. 9:19 For* the
authority of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for* their tails are similar to those of
serpents, having heads, and they are hurting men with* them. 9:20 And the rest of mankind, who were
not killed with* these wounds, did not repent from the works of their hands, in-order-that they should
not worship the demons and the golden and silver and the brass and the stone and the wooden idols,
which are not able to see, nor hear, nor walk. 9:21 And they did not repent from their murders, nor
from their sorceries, nor from their fornication, nor from their various thefts.

the rainbow is upon his head and his face is like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire; 10:2 and
holding a book in the hand, which has been opened and he placed his right foot upon the sea and the
left upon the earth; 10:3 and he cried out with a loud voice, just-like a lion roars and when he cried out,
the seven thunders spoke their own voices.
    10:4
          And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven
saying, Seal up the things which the seven thunders spoke and do not write them. 10:5 And the
messenger whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his right hand to the
heaven, 10:6 and had sworn by the one who lives forevermore, who created the heaven and the things
in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it, that there will be time no longer
{i.e. a delay}. 10:7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger, whenever he is about to sound,
and the mystery of God was completed, as he proclaimed the good-news to his bondservants, the
prophets. 10:8 And the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard it again speaking with me and saying,
Proceed-away, take the book which has been opened in the hand of the messenger the one standing
upon the sea and upon the earth. 10:9 And I went away to the messenger, saying to him to give me the
book.
    And he says to me, Take it and devour it, and it will make your belly bitter, but it will be sweet
like honey in your mouth. 10:10 And I took the book out-of the messenger’s hand and devoured it, and
it was sweet as honey in my mouth, and when I ate it, my belly was made bitter.

          And they are saying to me, It is essential for you to prophesy again over many peoples and
nations and languages and kings.

temple cast forth outside {i.e., leave it out} and do not measure it, because it was given to the nations

will make* war with them and overcome them and kill them. 11:8 And the corpses of them lay in the
street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was
crucified. 11:9 And some out-of the peoples and tribes and languages and nations look at their corpses
three and a half days and they will not allow their corpses to be laid in a tomb. 11:10 And the ones
dwelling upon the earth rejoice over them and will be joyous, and they will be giving gifts to one
another, because these two prophets tormented the ones dwelling upon the earth. 11:11 And after the
three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet, and
great fear fell upon the ones viewing them. 11:12 And they heard a loud voice out-of heaven saying

saying, Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ

beast or the number of its name. 13:18 Here is wisdom: he who has perception, let him calculate the
number of the beast; for* it is the number of man and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. {i.e.,

Send forth your sickle and reap, because the hour to reap came, because the harvest of the earth is
ripe. 14:16 And he who sits upon the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.
     14:17
           Another messenger came forth from the temple, the one in heaven, he himself also having
a sharp sickle. 14:18 And another messenger came forth out-of the altar, having authority over the fire,
and he shouted to the one who holding the sharp sickle with a loud outcry, saying, Send forth your
sharp sickle and pick the clusters of the vine from the earth, because her grape-clusters were prime.
14:19
      And the messenger cast his sickle into the earth and picked the clusters of the vine of the earth
and cast it into the winepress, the great winepress of the fury of God. 14:20 And the winepress was
trampled on outside the city and blood came forth out-of the winepress, even up-to the bridles of the
horses, from one thousand six hundred furlongs.

     15:1
           And I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven, seven messengers holding the last
seven wounds, because the fury of God was completed in them.
     15:2
           And I saw something like a glassy sea having been mixed with fire, and the ones who are
overcoming away from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name, standing
upon the glassy sea, having harps of God. 15:3 And they are singing the song of Moses the
bondservant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord
God, the Almighty; your ways are righteous and true*, the King of the nations. 15:4 Who should never
fear you, Lord, and should glorify your name? Because only you are holy, because all the nations
will be coming and will be worshiping in your sight because your righteousnesses were manifested.

    15:5
          And after I saw these things and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony was
opened in heaven, 15:6 the seven messengers who have the seven wounds came forth from the temple,
who were clothing themselves with clean bright flax-linen and golden belts had been girded around
their chests. 15:7 And one out-of the four living creatures gave to the seven messengers seven golden
bowls full of the fury of God, the one living forevermore. 15:8 And the temple was filled with smoke
from the glory of God and from his power and no one was able to enter into the temple till the seven
wounds from the seven messengers should be completed.

    16:1
         And I heard a loud voice out-of the temple, saying to the seven messengers, Proceed° away and
pour° out the seven bowls of the fury of God into the earth.
    16:2
          And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became an evil sore and
wicked upon the men who have the mark of the beast and the ones worshiping its image.
    16:3
         And the second messenger poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like that of
the dead, and every living soul died in the sea.
    16:4
         And the third messenger poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of the waters, and
it became blood. 16:5 And I heard the messenger of the waters saying, You are righteous, who is and
who was, the Holy One, because you judged these things; 16:6 because they poured out the blood of
holy-ones and prophets and you gave blood to them to drink because they are worthy. 16:7 And I heard
out-of the altar saying, Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, your judgments are true* and righteous.
    16:8
         And the fourth messenger poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given to it to burn men
in fire. 16:9 And men were burnt with great heat and the men blasphemed the name of God who has
the authority over these wounds, and they did not repent to give him glory.
    16:10
          And the fifth messenger poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom
became darkened, and they were gnawing their tongues out-of pain, 16:11 and they blasphemed the
God of heaven out-of their pains and out-of their sores, and they did not repent from their works.
    16:12
          And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up
in-order-that the way of the kings who come from the rising of the sun might be prepared. 16:13 And
I saw out-of the mouth of the dragon and out-of the mouth of the beast and out-of the mouth of the
false* prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs, 16:14 for* they are spirits of demons, doing* signs, and
which travel out over the kings of the whole inhabited-earth, to gather them together to the war of
that great day of God the Almighty. 16:15 (Behold, I am coming like a thief. The fortunate one is
watching and keeping his garments, in-order-that he may not walk naked and in-order-that they may
see his indecency.) 16:16 And they gathered them together into the place, the one called Har-Magedon
in Hebrew.

temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It has happened. 16:18 And lightnings and thunders and
voices happened, and a great earthquake, such-as did not happen from which time the men were born
upon the earth, so-great an earthquake: so great! 16:19 And the great city became divided into three
parts and the cities of the nations fell and Babylon the great was remembered in God’s sight, to give
to her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. 16:20 And every island fled away and the mountains
were not found. 16:21 And great hail, approximately a talant’s poundage, {i.e., 58-80 lbs.} descends from
heaven upon men and men blasphemed God from the wound of the hail, because its wound is
extremely great.

    17:1
         And one out-of the seven messengers who have the seven bowls came and spoke with me,
saying, Come-here; I will be showing you the judgment of the great prostitute the one sitting upon
many waters, 17:2 with whom the kings of the earth fornicated and the ones dwelling on the earth were
made drunken from the wine of her fornication. 17:3 And he carried me away in the Spirit into a
wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, being full of names of blasphemy, having
seven heads and ten horns. 17:4 And the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet arrayed with gold
and precious stone and pearls, holding a golden cup in her hand being full of abominations and the
unclean things of her fornication, 17:5 and a name has been written upon her forehead, Mystery,
Babylon the Great, the Mother of the Prostitutes and of the Abominations of the Earth. 17:6 And I saw
the woman drunken from the blood of the holy-ones and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.
And I marveled, having seen her, with great marvel! 17:7 And the messenger said to me, Why did you
marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast bearing her, which has the seven
heads and the ten horns. 17:8 The beast which you saw, was and is not and is about to come-up out-of
the abyss is to proceed-away into destruction. And the ones dwelling upon the earth of whose names
have not been written upon the Book of Life from the conception of the world will be marveling,
while seeing that the beast was and is not and will be present*.
    17:9
         Here is the mind, the one having wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains, where the
woman is sitting upon them, 17:10 and they are seven kings; the five fell, the one is, the other did not
yet come, and whenever he comes, it is essential for him to remain a small time. 17:11 And the beast
which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is out-of the seven, and he is proceeding-away
into destruction. 17:12 And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who did not yet receive a
kingdom, but they receive authority like kings, with the beast, for one hour. 17:13 These have one
intention and they are giving their power and authority to the beast. 17:14 These will make war with
the Lamb and the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and the
invited and chosen and faithful ones with him. 17:15 And he says to me, The waters which you saw,
where the prostitute is sitting, are peoples and crowds and nations and languages. 17:16 And the ten
horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the prostitute and they will make* her desolate
and they will be making her naked and they will eat her flesh and will be burning her up in fire. 17:17
For* God gave to their hearts to do* his intention and to do* it with one intention and to give their
kingdom to the beast, till the words of God should be completed. 17:18 And the woman whom you saw
is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.

    18:1
         I saw after these things another messenger descending from heaven, having great authority,
and the earth was illuminated from his glory. 18:2 And he cried out in a strong voice, saying, Babylon
the great has fallen and it became a residence of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit and a
prison of every unclean and having been hated bird. 18:3 Because out-of the wine of the fury of her
fornication all the nations have fallen, and the kings of the earth fornicated with her and the
merchants of the earth were enriched from the power of her promiscuity.
    18:4
         And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come forth out-of her, my people, in-order-
that you° might not have fellowship together in her sins and in-order-that you° might not receive out-
of her wounds, 18:5 because her sins were joined to her even up-to the heaven and God has
remembered her wrongdoings. 18:6 Repay° to her as she also gave to you° and double to her, double°
again according-to her works, in the cup which she mingled, mingle° to her double again. 18:7 In how-
much she glorified herself and was promiscuous, give° to her so-much more torment and mourning,
because she says in her heart, I am sitting as a queen and I am no widow and should never see
mourning. 18:8 Because of this, in one day her wounds will come: death and mourning and famine.
And she will be utterly burned in fire, because the Lord God who judged her is strong. 18:9 And the
kings of the earth, who fornicated and were promiscuous with her, will weep and will grieve over
her, whenever they look upon the smoke of her fire, 18:10 standing from afar because of their fear of
her torment, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! Because your judgment came
in one hour. 18:11 And the merchants of the earth will weep and will mourn over her, because no one
is buying their cargo anymore, 18:12 cargo of {F} gold, silver, precious stone, pearl, fine-linen, purple,
silk, scarlet, every citron wood thing, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made out-of precious wood
and from brass, iron and marble; 18:13 and cinnamon, incenses, perfume, frankincense, wine, oil, fine-
flour, grain, sheep, other animals, and of horses and of chariots and of bodies and souls of men. 18:14
And the autumn-fruit of lust of your soul went away from you and all the luxurious and bright things
have perished from you and you should never find them anymore. 18:15 The merchants of these things,
who were enriched from her, will be standing from afar because of the fear of her torment, while
weeping and mourning. 18:16 And they are saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she who has been dressed
in fine-linen, and purple and scarlet and has been arrayed in gold, precious stone and pearls! 18:17
Because in one hour so-many riches was made desolate. And every helmsman and everyone sailing
upon the place and sailors and as many as are working from the sea, stood from afar, 18:18 and were
crying out, seeing the smoke of her fire, saying, What city is similar to the great city? 18:19 And they
cast dirt upon their heads and were crying, weeping and mourning and saying, Woe, woe, the great
city, in which all who have their ships in the sea were enriched out-of her costliness! Because in one
hour she was made desolate. 18:20 Be joyous over her, heaven and the holy-ones and the apostles and
the prophets, because God judged your° condemnation out-of her {i.e., maybe: on her}.
    18:21
          And one strong messenger lifted up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea,
saying, So Babylon, the great city, will be cast down, with a violent-impulse, and should never be
found anymore. 18:22 And the voice of harpists and musicians and flute-players and trumpeters should
never be heard in you anymore, and every craftsman of every craft should never be found in you
anymore, and the voice of a millstone should never be heard in you anymore, 18:23 and the light of a

nations were misled in your sorcery. 18:24 And the bloods {i.e. lives} of prophets and of holy-ones and

The salvation and the power and the glory is from our God: 19:2 because true* and righteous are his
judgments, because he judged the great prostitute, she who was corrupting the earth in her
fornication, and he avenged the blood of his bondservants from her hand.

him. And he says to me, See that you do not do that. I am a fellow bondservant of you and of your
brethren who are holding the testimony of Jesus. Worship God; for* the testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy.

written on them and a name which has been written which no one knows except himself. 19:13 And
he has been dressed in a garment, having been dipped in blood, and his name is called The Word of
God. 19:14 And the armies, the ones in heaven, were following him upon white horses, and have
clothed themselves in clean white fine-linen. 19:15 And a sharp two edged long-sword travels out
from his mouth in-order-that he might strike the nations with* it and he will shepherd them with* an
iron rod and he tramples on the winepress of wine of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. 19:16

clutched and with him the false* prophet who made* the signs in his sight, in which he misled the
ones who had received the mark of the beast and the ones worshiping his image. The two were cast
while living into the lake of fire which is burning in brimstone. 19:21 And the rest were killed with*
the long-sword of the one who sits upon the horse, the sword which came forth out-of his mouth,

Adversary, the one who is misleading the whole inhabited-earth and bound him a thousand years,

their forehead and upon their hand, and they lived and reigned with Christ the thousand years. 20:5
And the rest of the dead did not live till the thousand years might be completed. This is the first
resurrection. 20:6 The fortunate and holy one is the one who has part in the first resurrection; the
second death has no authority over these, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ and will
be reigning with him a thousand years. {Rev 1:6, 5:10}

earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together into war. The number of them is like the sand of the
sea. 20:9 And they went-up over the width of the earth and surrounded the encampment of the holy-
ones and the beloved city and fire out-of heaven descended from God and devoured them. 20:10 And

the Lamb. 21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a mountain great and high and showed me the
great holy city Jerusalem, descending out-of heaven from God, 21:11 having the glory of God. Her
illumination is similar to a precious stone, like a crystal-like jasper stone, 21:12 having a great and high
wall, having twelve gates and twelve messengers upon the gates, and names have been written on
them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. 21:13 Three gates were from the
rising {i.e., east} and three gates were from the north, and three gates were from the south, and three
gates were from the west. 21:14 And the wall of the city has twelve foundations and upon them twelve
names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 21:15 And the one speaking with me was holding a measure,
a golden reed, in-order-that he might measure the city and her gates and her wall. 21:16 And the four
cornered city is laid, and the length is as the width and he measured the city with the reed in furlongs,
twelve thousand and twelve furlongs; the length and the width, and her height are equal {i.e., a 1380
mile cube, approximately 1/10 the size of the earth by volume if literal} . 21:17 And he measured her wall, a
hundred and forty-four cubits, according-to the measure of a man, which is, of a messenger. 21:18 And
the structure of her wall was jasper and the city was purest gold, similar to purest glass. 21:19 The
foundations of the wall of the city have been adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation
was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 21:20 the fifth, sardonyx;
the sixth, carnelian; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase;
the eleventh, hyacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls apiece;
each one of the gates was from one pearl, and the street of the city was purest gold like transparent
glass. 21:22 And I saw no temple in it, for* the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are her temple.

thing and anyone practicing an abomination and a lie should never enter into it, except the ones
